# Utah Native Plants Research Task

## Objective
Build a comprehensive database of 50+ Utah native and adapted plants optimized for:
- Pollinator habitat (bees, butterflies, hummingbirds, moths)
- Water conservation (Localscapes-compatible)
- Wasatch Front growing conditions
- Year-round bloom coverage

## Priority Plant Categories

### 1. CRITICAL: Early Spring Bloomers (March-April)
Gap in most gardens - pollinators emerge hungry!
- Find 5-8 plants that bloom March-April in Utah
- Must be cold-hardy (Zone 5-6)

### 2. CRITICAL: Late Season Bloomers (September-October)  
Support migrating butterflies and pre-winter bees
- Find 5-8 plants blooming into fall
- Rabbitbrush is one - find more

### 3. Native Bee Specialists
Plants Utah's 900+ native bee species depend on
- Penstemon species (beardtongues) - how many varieties?
- Sunflower family natives
- Plants with specific bee relationships

### 4. Butterfly Host Plants
Not just nectar - caterpillar food sources!
- Monarch: milkweed species native to Utah
- Painted Lady hosts
- Swallowtail hosts (native Apiaceae)

### 5. Hummingbird Plants
Tubular flowers, red/orange preferred
- Native Penstemon species
- Agastache varieties
- Native honeysuckles?

### 6. Ultra-Low Water (Zone 0-1)
For the driest spots - no supplemental irrigation
- Succulents and sedums native to region
- Desert shrubs (Apache plume, cliffrose)
- Native bunch grasses

### 7. Groundcover Lawn Alternatives
Replace grass in park strips
- Creeping thyme
- Native sedges
- What else works in Utah?

### 8. Native Grasses
Support moths, provide habitat structure
- Blue grama
- Indian ricegrass
- Buffalo grass
- Which work on Wasatch Front?

## For Each Plant, Research:

### Pollinator Value (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Nectar value (1-5)
- [ ] Pollen value (1-5)

### Water/Maintenance
- [ ] Estimated gallons per week (established)
