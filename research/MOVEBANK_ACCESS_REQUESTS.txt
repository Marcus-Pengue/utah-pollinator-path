REQUEST TEMPLATE:
-----------------
Subject: Data Access Request - Utah Pollinator Conservation Project

Dear [Name],

I am working on an open-source conservation project mapping wildlife 
corridors and pollinator habitat across Utah (Rainbow Road / Utah Pollinator Path).

Your [study name] dataset would greatly enhance our understanding of 
wildlife movement patterns in the region. The data will be used for:
- Habitat connectivity analysis
- Conservation prioritization
- Public education tools

Project: https://github.com/Marcus-Pengue/utah-pollinator-path

Would you be willing to grant access for research purposes?

Thank you,
Marcus Pengue
