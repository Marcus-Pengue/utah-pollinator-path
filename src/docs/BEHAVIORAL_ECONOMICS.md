# Utah Pollinator Path - Behavioral Economics & Choice Architecture

## Core Principles

### 1. Defaults (Most Powerful Lever)
People stick with whatever is pre-selected.

| Application | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Opt-OUT chemical lawns | Partner with lawn services, organic = default |
| Pre-selected plant kits | September bloomers auto-included |
| Auto-enrolled challenges | "You're in! Opt out if you want" |

### 2. Loss Aversion (2x More Powerful Than Gains)
Reframe everything as loss.

| Gain Frame (Weak) | Loss Frame (Strong) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Attract 50 butterflies" | "You're losing 84% of potential monarch visits" |
| "Your score is 65%" | "You're missing 35 points worth of habitat" |
| "Plant milkweed to help" | "Without milkweed, passing monarchs have nowhere to stop" |
| "Add water for pollinators" | "Pollinators are dying of dehydration within 500m of your yard" |

### 3. Social Proof (The Neighbor Effect)

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Ward-level stats | "23 families in Murray 4th Ward have certified" |
| Direct comparison | "Your neighbor on 700 E scored 87%" |
| Block completion | "This block has 4 certified habitats. Be #5." |

**Physical manifestations:**
- Yard signs: "Certified Pollinator Habitat"
- Window clings with QR code
- Street markers: "Pollinator Corridor"

### 4. Identity (Make It Who They Are)

| Score Range | Title | Badge |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| 0-40% | Seedling | 🌱 |
| 40-60% | Pollinator Friend | 🐝 |
| 60-80% | Habitat Guardian | 🦋 |
| 80-90% | Migration Champion | 👑 |
| 90%+ | Pollinator Path Pioneer | ⭐ |

### 5. Commitment Devices

| Device | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Public pledge wall | Name + photo on website |
| Before/after photos | Required for certification |
| Seasonal check-ins | "It's September - time for your migration report!" |
| Neighbor pairing | Accountability partners |

**Escalation ladder:**
1. Enter address (tiny commitment)
2. See score (emotional investment)
3. Sign pledge (public commitment)
4. Order seeds (financial commitment)
5. Plant garden (physical commitment)
6. Upload photos (documentation)
7. Get yard sign (identity commitment)

### 6. Friction Reduction

| Friction Point | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| "What should I plant?" | Pre-designed templates for exact elevation |
| "Where do I buy it?" | One-click ordering, nursery partnerships |
| "How do I plant it?" | QR code → 2-minute video |
| "Did it work?" | Auto-reminder to photograph in September |

**Goal:** Address → Certified Habitat in <30 minutes of effort.

### 7. Temporal Discounting (Immediate > Future)

| Distant Reward (Weak) | Immediate Reward (Strong) |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| "Help save monarchs for future generations" | "Get your yard sign this weekend" |
| "Butterflies will come eventually" | "See visitors within 6 weeks" |
| "Points accumulate over time" | "Your score updates live" |

### 8. Urgency (The September Advantage)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🦋 MONARCH MIGRATION IN 47 DAYS            │
│  Your yard isn't ready.                     │
│  [See what you're missing] [Fix it now]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- "Only 23 days left to plant for this year's migration"
- "You missed 2024. Don't miss 2025."

### 9. Reciprocity
Give first, they reciprocate.

| Gift | Expected Return |
|------|-----------------|
| Free seed packet | Plant it, report back |
| Free yard assessment | Sign the pledge |
| Free yard sign | Maintain certification |

### 10. Anchoring
First number = reference point.

| Without Anchor | With Anchor |
|----------------|-------------|
| "Plant some milkweed" | "Ideal yard has 15 milkweed. You have 0." |
| "Improve your score" | "Pioneer status requires 90%. You're at 65%." |

## Key Quotes

> "Don't ask people to care about pollinators. Ask them to not be the gap in the corridor."

> "Every yard that goes dark in September is a monarch that didn't make it to Mexico."
