Despite numerous observations of songbirds migrating over remote islands, virtually nothing is known about the proportion of songbirds risking to fly offshore rather than to follow the coastline. By means of large-scale automated radio-telemetry, we individually tracked songbirds during their autumn migration through the German Bight area in the south-eastern North Sea. Our tracking network facilitated the recording of movement patterns over the bay and, for the first time, the estimation of the proportions of individuals embarking on offshore flights from their coastal stopover sites. Our data are consistent with previous observations of decreasing migration densities from nearshore to offshore, i.e. from east to west in autumn. Still, we revealed a considerable proportion of 25% of birds flying offshore. The tendency to fly offshore decreased from west to south migrants, which is in line with optimal bird migration theory. Among south-west migrating species, which also comprise the vast majority of songbird species migrating through the German Bight area, thrushes showed the highest proportions of offshore flights. Considering the recent and ongoing increase of artificial offshore structures, our results suggest that some species or species groups might especially face an increased risk of being negatively affected.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2017-09-27 17:15:00.000,2019-09-15 21:01:13.000,430,"Sturnus vulgaris,Turdus merula,Turdus iliacus,Acrocephalus schoenobaenus,Erithacus rubecula,Prunella modularis,Sylvia atricapilla,Sylvia borin,Sylvia communis,Turdus philomelos","Radio Transmitter","VeraBrust (Vera Brust)"

To identify and interpret commonalities within clusters, we compared them to computer-simulated idealized movement syndromes representing suites of correlated movement traits observed across taxa (migration, nomadism, territoriality, and central place foraging). Two principal components explained 70% of the variance among the movement metrics we evaluated across the thirteen species, and were used for the cluster analysis. The resulting analysis revealed four statistically distinct clusters. All simulated individuals of each idealized movement syndrome organized into separate clusters, suggesting that the four clusters are explained by common movement syndrome. Our results offer early indication of widespread recurrent patterns in movement ecology that have consistent statistical signatures, regardless of taxon, body size, mode of movement, or environment.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2004-02-19 00:00:00.000,2012-06-03 23:00:00.000,569474,"Zalophus californianus,Mirounga angustirostris,Canis mesomelas,Syncerus caffer,Gyps africanus,Phoebastria irrorata,Loxodonta africana,Equus quagga,Antidorcas marsupialis,Chelonoidis hoodensis,Chelonoidis porteri","GPS,Argos Doppler Shift","briana.abrahms (Briana Abrahms)"

Human-caused forest loss, fragmentation, and degradation have resulted in biodiversity declines globally; unsustainable timber-logging is one of the largest drivers of forest loss and degradation. Harvest-driven shifts in forest structure and composition have considerable implications for wildlife species, with logging activities appearing beneficial for some wildlife species and detrimental to others. Our objective was to determine the effects of logging activities on fine-scale carnivore movement and habitat selection. We generated step selection functions from 1-hour interval spatial data from nine GPS-collared bobcats. Specifically, we examined how different post-harvest forest stands and canopy cover influenced bobcat habitat selection while controlling for other landscape features such as slope and distance to paved roads, logging roads, and streams in the Olympic Peninsula of western Washington, USA. We also tested the percent at which bobcat selection for canopy cover saturates. We found that bobcats avoided the young forest stands less than 5 years of age and older and mature forest stands exceeding 40 years of age. Bobcats selected for the forest age class spanning 6–15 years and gentler slopes. We also found that bobcat selection for canopy cover peaked at 66 % canopy cover. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating different forms of human modification on species' habitat selection to inform how human resource extraction impacts species.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2021-03-20 20:00:00.000,2024-09-28 19:00:00.000,20846,"Lynx rufus","GPS","ucsc@bobcat (Laurel Serieys)"

Animals must balance seasonal and daily changes to landscape risk with the underlying resources provided by that landscape. One way to balance the seasonal and daily changes in the costs and benefits of a landscape is through behaviorally-explicit resource selection and temporal partitioning. Here, we test whether resource selection of coyotes (Canis latrans) in Cape Breton Highlands National Park, Nova Scotia, Canada is behaviorally-explicit and responsive to the daily and seasonal variation to presumed costs and benefits of moving on the landscape. We used GPS data and local convex hulls to estimate space use and Hidden Markov Models to estimate three types of movement behavior: encamped, foraging, and traveling. We then used integrated step-selection analysis to investigate behaviorally explicit resource selection across times of day (diurnal, crepuscular, and nocturnal) and season (snow-free and snow). We found that throughout the day and seasonally coyotes shifted foraging behavior and altered behavior and resource choices to avoid moving across what we could be a challenging landscape. These changes in behavior suggest that coyotes have a complex response to land cover, terrain, and linear corridors that are not only scale dependent but also vary by behavior, diel period, and season. By examining the resource selection across three axes (behavior, time of day, and season), we have a more nuanced understanding of how a predator balances the cost and benefits of a stochastic environment.","research",true,true,false,false,false,"na",,,,,"GPS","e.hance (Hance Ellington)"

To investigate spatial and temporal responses of a generalist carnivore to human disturbance, we investigated habitat selection and diel activity patterns in caracals (Caracal caracal). We GPS-collared 25 adults and subadults in urban and wildland-dominated subregions in Cape Town, South Africa. Selection responses for landscape variables were dependent on subregion, animal age class, and diel period. Contrary to expectations, caracals did not become more nocturnal in urban areas. Caracals increased their selection for proximity to urban areas as the proportion of urban area increased. Differences in habitat selection between urban and wildland caracals suggest that individuals of this generalist species exhibit high behavioral flexibility in response to anthropogenic disturbances that emerge as a function of habitat context.

Traditional studies, primarily based on laboratory experiments and displacement studies, may not capture the complexity of navigation in natural environments. In this study, we applied a data mining approach to investigate the navigational strategies of greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) during their annual migrations between the Arctic and central Europe. We integrated a decade of tracking data from 143 individuals with high-resolution geomagnetic data (including dynamic variations induced by solar wind) as well as wind conditions, and a potential visual cue. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified multi-modal and interrelated navigation strategies that flexibly adapt to environmental conditions such as wind, diurnal cycles, and flock-specific dynamics. Under favourable tailwinds, geese maintained stable headings with minimal changes in geomagnetic heading and apparent angle of geomagnetic inclination, consistent with both geomagnetic loxodrome and magnetoclinic routes, enabling efficient flights toward stopovers or concurrently aligning with stopovers and final destinations. Additionally, geese appeared to integrate visual cues with geomagnetic information and adjust their reliance on landmarks based on the day-night cycle. These findings highlight the complexity and adaptability of avian navigation, emphasising the importance of multi-modal sensory integration and environmental context in shaping migratory decisions.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2015-03-11 08:00:35.000,2023-05-21 15:15:15.000,466595,"Anser albifrons","GPS","andreakoelzsch (Andrea Kölzsch)"

For example, giant armadillos (Priodontes maximus) are the largest extant species of armadillo but are rarely encountered due to their fossorial and nocturnal behavior. Through the analysis of speed, turning angles, and accelerometer activity counts, we estimated behavioral states, characterized activity budgets, and investigated the state-habitat associations exhibited by individuals monitored with GPS telemetry in the Brazilian Pantanal from 2019 to 2020. This methodology is proposed as a useful framework for the identification of priority habitat. Using the non-parametric Bayesian mixture model for movement (M3), we estimated four latent behavioral states that were named ‘vigilance-excavation’, ‘local search’, ‘exploratory’, and ‘transit’. These states appeared to correspond with behavior near burrows or termite mounds, foraging, ranging, and rapid movements, respectively. The first and last hours of activity presented relatively high proportions of the vigilance-excavation state, while most of the activity period was dominated by local search and exploratory states. The vigilance-excavation state occurred more frequently in regions between forest and closed savannas, whereas local search was more likely in high proportions of closed savanna. Exploratory behavior probability increased in high proportions of both forest and closed savanna. Our results establish a baseline for behavioral complexity, activity budgets, and habitat associations in a pristine environment for future work that investigates anthropogenic impacts on giant armadillo behavior and fitness. The integration of accelerometer and GPS-derived movement data through our mixture model has the potential to become a powerful methodological approach for the conservation of other cryptic species.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2019-05-19 00:17:04.000,2020-01-24 01:26:12.000,13483,,"GPS","nina.attias (Nina Attias)"

The use of public information can lead to the aggrega- tion of foragers at prey patches, a mechanism known as local enhancement. However, when ephemeral resources are distributed over large areas, foragers may also need to increase search efficiency, and thus apply social strategies when sampling the landscape. While sensory networks of visually oriented animals have already been confirmed, we lack an understanding of how acoustic eavesdropping adds to the formation of sensory networks. Here we radio-tracked a total of 81 aerial-hawking bats at very high spatio- temporal resolution during five sessions over 3 y, recording up to 19 individuals simul- taneously. Analyses of interactive flight behavior provide conclusive evidence that bats form temporary mobile sensory networks by adjusting their movements to neighboring conspecifics while probing the airspace for prey. Complementary agent-based simula- tions confirmed that the observed movement patterns can lead to the formation of mobile sensory networks, and that bats located prey faster when networking than when relying only on local enhancement or searching solitarily. However, the benefitof net- working diminished with decreasing group size. The combination of empirical analyses and simulations elucidates how animal groups use acoustic information to efficiently locate unpredictable and ephemeral food patches. Our results highlight that declining local populations of social foragers may thus suffer from Allee effects that increase the risk of collapses under global change scenarios, like insect decline and habitat degradation.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2018-05-12 19:04:11.000,2020-08-02 20:51:15.000,126097,"Nyctalus noctula","Radio Transmitter","manuelroeleke (Manuel Roeleke)"

The invasion of new areas is influenced by landscape structure, seasonal conditions, and social interactions. Coastal and lake landscapes pose unique challenges for land animals due to water barriers, while the ice cover in northern latitudes can facilitate movement. For invasive alien species, information on movement capabilities provides data for management.
2. This study examines the movement patterns of an invasive mesopredator, raccoon dog, in a fragmented coastal environment in southwestern Finland to better understand its movement capabilities and potential expansion. Using GPS tracking, we investigated individual movements between islands, considering the role of ice cover, island connectivity, and social interactions (partner removal by management). 
3. The raccoon dog has low winter activity levels, but our findings demonstrate that the individuals remain active during cold season and use ice cover to reach islands perhaps otherwise unreachable. The number and connectivity of islands also play a crucial role in movement distances. Moreover, the partner removal increases movement between islands during the summer. We conclude that the raccoon dog is highly mobile in coastal landscape, with ice cover facilitating movements between islands. 
4. Practical implication: To effectively manage this invasive species, creating single individuals should be avoided before avian breeding season. This strategy can help prevent solitary raccoon dogs from wandering and potentially colonizing new areas. Melting ice due to climate change is often mentioned as a benefit to invasive species, but our results provide an example of where the ice cover potentially enhances movement of an invasive species and thus requires consideration.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2019-08-30 11:56:00.000,2024-06-24 21:01:14.000,18392,"Nyctereutes procyonoides","GPS","pntoiv (Pyry Toivonen)"

However, the cryptic behaviors and prolonged inactivity of large reptiles generate unique movement patterns, making traditional methods of space-use estimation inadequate for fully capturing their movement ecology. Here, we hypothesize that seasonal hydrological variability shapes the movement strategies of American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus) in the Tempisque River Basin, Costa Rica, where management efforts are intended. To address this, we applied dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMMs) to GPS data from ten individual crocodiles to model movement paths, estimate movement parameters, and infer behavioral states. Our findings reveal multiple distinct seasonal strategies, including migration and aestivation. Movement intensity varied by sex, size, and habitat, with larger crocodiles and males displaying greater movement, particularly in riverine environments. Increased rainfall triggered higher activity, while dry conditions corresponded with less movement. These insights deepen our understanding of crocodile movement ecology and highlight the importance of accounting for behavioral flexibility in conservation strategies for populations facing environmental variability and human- wildlife conflict.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2024-03-26 17:43:00.000,2024-07-06 20:34:00.000,2446,"Crocodylus acutus","GPS","maggie.mcgreal (Maggie McGreal)"

This information helps understand the dependence of these birds on habitats and stop-over sites during migration and will create awareness of the importance of connectivity along the West Asian East African Flyway.
583 birds of 18 species were caught amongst which 200 of 4 target species. All birds were ringed and in addition, all target species were colour-ringed. 54 birds were fitted with a transmitter, using a range of transmission techniques to optimize the chances of obtaining a mix of detailed and continuous information about the whereabouts of the birds.  
Three months after transmitter deployment already a wealth of data has been gathered on the local habitat use by the birds and migration has started with the a number of birds demonstrating intriguing migration trajectories (situation April 2023).

These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. We examined the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity of intraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, as spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but during periods of resource limitation (dry season), also rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild predation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas) especially in the dry season. Leopard and cheetah overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviours and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. The smallest species (African wild dog) avoided lions and used multiple tactics to minimise encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially-explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2000-09-02 06:23:00.000,2005-11-30 16:47:00.000,35723,"Panthera leo,Panthera pardus,Acinonyx jubatus,Lycaon pictus","Radio Transmitter","abivanak (Abi Tamim Vanak)"

Consumer fireworks during New Year (NY) are widely distributed in W-Europe and cause strong disturbances that are known to incur stress responses in animals. We analysed GPS tracks of 347 wild migratory geese of four species during eight NYs quantifying the effects of fireworks on individuals. We show that, in parallel with particulate matter increases, during the night of NY geese flew on average 5 - 16 km further and 40 - 150 m higher, and more often shifted to new roost sites than on previous nights. This was also true during the 2020/21 fireworks ban, despite fireworks activity being reduced. Likely to compensate for extra flight costs, most geese moved less and increased their feeding activity in the following days. Our findings indicate negative effects of NY fireworks on wild birds beyond the previously demonstrated immediate response.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2013-12-19 00:11:22.000,2021-01-12 23:53:49.000,280312,"Branta leucopsis,Anser albifrons,Anser fabalis,Anser brachyrhynchus","GPS","andreakoelzsch (Andrea Kölzsch)"

biodiversity and regulating hydrology. However, they are increasingly threatened by the expansion of aquaculture,
agriculture, and urbanization with consequences for species that depend on wetlands for survival and persistence. Here, we evaluate how a sensitive wetland species behaviorally adapts to wetland conversion. We examine the habitat selection of fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus), a wetland-specialist carnivore, in an area fragmented by shrimp ponds, abandoned aquacultural ponds with marshy vegetation, and agriculture. We used integrated step selection functions to analyze movement-based habitat selection of 13 fishing cats and resource selection functions to examine resting-based habitat selection of a subset of 9 fishing cats because habitat selection differences may arise for differing behaviors with implications for conservation and management of species. Results indicate that, while moving, fishing cats selected for shrimp ponds, abandoned aquacultural ponds, and low elevations while avoiding agricultural areas and villages. While resting, fishing cats selected for abandoned aquacultural ponds with marshy vegetation and low elevations while also avoiding agriculture and villages. Although other felid studies have found differences in habitat use and selection between males and females, we found few habitat selection differences between sexes. Our findings demonstrate the resilience of this wetland specialist to some types of anthropogenic landscape change. Encouraging local landowners to let abandoned shrimp ponds naturally revegetate could provide essential refuges for wildlife. Incentives for this conservation strategy would support biodiversity and the persistence wetland specialists in human-dominated landscapes.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2022-06-26 00:00:00.000,2024-03-22 23:50:07.000,56939,"Prionailurus viverrinus","GPS,Acceleration","Pantherathailand (SUPAWAT KHAEWPHAKDEE)"

Migration is a prominent aspect of the life history of many avian species, but the demographic consequences of variable migration strategies have only infrequently been investigated, and rarely when using modern technological and analytical methods for assessing survival, movement patterns, and long-term productivity in the context of life history theory. We monitored the fates of 50 satellite-implanted tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) over 4 years from five disparate breeding areas in Alaska, and used known-fate analyses to estimate monthly survival probability relative to migration distance, breeding area, migratory flyway, breeding status, and age. We specifically tested whether migratory birds face a trade-off, whereby long-distance migrants realize higher survival rates at the cost of lower productivity because of reduced time on breeding areas relative to birds that migrate shorter distances and spend more time on breeding areas.
<br> <br>
<u>Results</u>: 
Annual migration distances varied significantly among breeding areas (1020 to 12720 km), and were strongly negatively correlated with time spent on breeding areas (r = -0.986). Estimates of annual survival probability varied by wintering area (Pacific coast, Alaska Peninsula, and Eastern seaboard) and ranged from 0.79 (95%CI: 0.70–0.88) to 1.0, depending on criteria used to discern mortalities from radio failures. We did not find evidence for a linear relationship between migration distance and survival as swans from the breeding areas with the shortest and longest migration distances had the highest survival probabilities. Survival was lower in the first year post-marking than in subsequent years, but there was not support for seasonal differences in survival. Productivity varied among breeding populations and was generally inversely correlated to survival, but not migration distance or time spent on breeding areas.
<br> <br>
<u>Conclusions</u>: 

Tundra swans conformed to a major tenet of life history theory, as populations with the highest survival generally had the lowest productivity. The lack of a uniform relationship between time spent on breeding areas and productivity, or time spent on wintering areas and survival, indicates that factors other than temporal investment dictate demographic outcomes in this species. The tremendous diversity of migration strategies we identify in Alaskan tundra swans, without clear impacts on survival, underscores the ability of this species to adapt to different environments and climatic regimes.

These records are not Argos data, and the 'comments' variable for these records has been coded '<i>manually_added_deployment_location</i>'. There are also manually added 'end' locations for tags believed to have detatched from the walrus while on land (based on sensor and location data). The comments variable for these records has been coded '<i>manually_added_onshore_shuck_location_estimate</i>'. These end locations are weighted averages of all Argos locations collected up to 7-days post-detachment. The Argos Location Class was used for weighting, with LC 3,2,1,0,A,B,Z assigned weights of 100,75,50,15,15,2,1 respectively. Location estimates based on a small sample of low-quality locations were sometimes misrepresentative, in which case the estimates were manually revised to coincide with a nearby coastal site while recognizing well-known frequently-used walrus haulouts. Finally, data for individuals #172 and #174 were actually collected from the same walrus that was instrumented with 2 tags.<br><br>

How birds use the western Beaufort Sea and other marine waters is unclear, and this information is needed to model the potential effects of off-shore oil and gas development. We used satellite telemetry (PTTs) to characterize migration and to identify wintering and staging areas of eiders and long-tailed ducks that molt in lagoons and other marine waters along the western Beaufort Sea coast. The primary objectives of this study were to locate and describe migration corridors, staging areas, and habitats used by eiders and long-tailed ducks during fall and spring migrations and compare and contrast migration strategies of these two species. Additional information can be obtained from the authors.

Here, we describe for the first time the movement patterns and locations of foraging areas used by lactating females from the only known maternity roost in central Mexico. GPS loggers were placed on 29 lactating females, adhered to the interscapular area with short-term surgical glue. We obtained movement tracks of at least one night for 21 different individuals. Movement patterns were identified using the first passage time segmentation method and classified into commutative and foraging flights. Bats made up to three trips on the same night, visiting between one and three foraging areas. On average, the total distance traveled was 61.72 km per night (minimum 23.11 km, maximum 160.55 km), and 37 foraging areas were identified, located between 13 and 40 km north of the roost, mainly in desert shrublands, followed by agricultural areas and temperate forests. In these places, they spent most of their time outside the roost (2.16 h mean ± 1.14 h SD), feeding on the resources available in an average area of 0.38 km2. Bats traveled long distances each night, using areas with abundant wild and human-cultivated floral resources, reflecting the importance of integrating movement ecology for the design of conservation and habitat management strategies that ensure the availability of necessary resources for this species.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2021-05-24 20:15:00.000,2022-06-08 00:40:00.000,709,"Leptonycteris nivalis","GPS","psoriva (Paulina Soriano-Varela)"

Important stopover locations and molting and wintering areas in marine waters are unknown, as is basic information such as the timing to and from stopover locations, the stopover duration and the origin (breeding population) of individuals. This information is needed to model the potential effects of off-shore oil and gas development, economic development of coastal areas, and the potential effects of a warming arctic. We used satellite telemetry (PTTs) to characterize migration and to identify wintering and staging areas of eiders that nested in: (1) northern Alaska (coastal barrier islands in the western Beaufort Sea between -149.940° and -145.941°; (2) western Alaska at Cape Espenberg (66.50°, -163.50°); (3) western Alaska on the YKD (61.173°, -165.597°); and (4) the Aleutian Archipelago. Wintering and stop-over locations of the most northern nesting population were in the most northern polynya (1300-1600 km from the nesting area) that predictably remained open throughout the winter. Birds from Cape Espenberg wintered to the south in open waters (400-700 km from the nesting area) and used the same general areas as the birds from the western Beaufort Sea and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Birds from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta winter in waters offshore from the marking location to open waters on the Alaska Peninsula. Eiders marked in the Aleutian Archipelago did not leave the Archipelago.

Foraging was studied with data loggers, a method not previously applied to the study of Galápagos barn owls. Owls rested during the day in natural and human-built roosts such as lava holes, trees, or huts. Night-time foraging was characterized by periods during which the bird moved and periods during which the bird stayed within one place, with the latter amounting to ~56% of the time away from the day roost. Birds began foraging shortly after sunset and returned to their day roost before sunrise. The duration of foraging was approximately 11 h per night. Foraging areas were small (median value: 0.28 km2). Although our data demonstrate a continued presence of the subspecies, we regard the situation for this subspecies as labile, as multiple threats, such as road kills, poisoning, and intentional killing by farmers, have increased recently, and suggest the development of a management plan to improve its conservation.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2016-03-01 21:38:30.000,2019-11-19 16:57:02.000,25274,"Tyto furcata","GPS","fhwagner (Hermann Wagner)"

The last decade has brought a worldwide surge of interest in rewilding—the repopulation of big herbivores and carnivores—as a strategy for conserving species and reviving ecosystem functions. Rewilding initiatives, if closely monitored, can provide unique insights into the ecology and environments of the world’s largest animals at otherwise impossible spatial and temporal scales. Capitalizing on these opportunities, and developing a knowledge base to guide future restoration efforts, requires the collection and dissemination of long-term data that document community reassembly. To date, such data are virtually nonexistent: most megafaunal restoration projects are nascent and/or have not been rigorously monitored. Since 2008, the Gorongosa Restoration Project, in Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park, has facilitated the recovery of megafauna populations that were severely depleted or extirpated during the country's civil war (1977–1992). Over the last decade, we have monitored Gorongosa’s large-herbivore populations to understand how animal behavior and species interactions evolve as communities reassemble. Here, we present two large and spatiotemporally explicit data sets on herbivore movements and diets from 2013–2023. This period encompassed extremes of climate (including the second-driest and five of the six wettest years on record) as well as the reintroduction, beginning in 2018, of locally extirpated apex predators (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus; spotted hyena, Crocutta crocutta; leopard, Panthera pardus). We used GPS telemetry to monitor 277 individual animals of seven herbivore species (listed below with number of individuals, median duration, and median number of location records per individual): Cape bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus: 103 individuals; 280 days; 6,646 fixes), nyala (T. angasii: 37 individuals; 306 days; 6,789 fixes), greater kudu (T. strepsiceros: 80 individuals; 301 days; 17,365 fixes), common eland (T. oryx: 10 individuals; 334 days; 15,783 fixes), waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus: 22 individuals; 13 days; 2,877 fixes), plains zebra (Equus quagga crawshayi: 7 individuals; 212 days; 1,171 fixes), and elephant (Loxodonta africana: 18 individuals; 707 days; 33,122 fixes). For 302 individuals that were immobilized during this work, we present morphological measurements (chest girth, body length, hind-foot length, weight), reproductive status and nutritional condition (ultrasound measurements, palpation scores), and fate (mortality date and cause, if known). In addition, we used DNA metabarcoding to quantify the composition of plants in 3,785 fecal samples from 27 mammal species representing 11 families and 7 orders. In all, we recorded 516 food-plant taxa from at least 87 families and 39 orders.

The initial methodology involved tagging two juvenile swifts—siblings hatched in early July 2024—marking the first such effort in Slovakia. Our primary aim is to document the inaugural migration routes of hatchlings and assess their natal philopatry as a form of breeding philopatry. A further objective is to determine whether individual birds follow consistent or divergent migratory pathways across successive years, considering both natural variability and potential influences of climate change.

Ultimately, the study seeks to identify when, where, and why hatchlings perish, thereby enabling the creation of mortality patterns that can inform conservation strategies and deepen understanding of swift population dynamics.","research",true,true,false,true,false,"na",2024-08-11 20:50:44.000,2024-08-27 07:08:26.000,34,"Apus apus","Sigfox Geolocation","Brani4swifts (Branislav Kadlecik)"

operating area (OPAREA) waters off the Virginia coast are heavily utilized for training and testing by the
U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. Over the past three years, HDR has worked with the U.S. Navy to
carry out vessel-based line transect visual surveys, photo-identification (photo ID) surveys, and focal
follow surveys with the goal of determining bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) densities and site
fidelity as well as humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) habitat use within waters adjacent to naval
Station Norfolk, Joint Expiditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck
Annex, and within and the MINEX W-50. 

To establish baseline occurrence and behavior data for humpback whales in the Hampton Roads mid-Atlantic region, this study aims to address the following questions:
• What age classes (juveniles, sub-adults, adults) are utilizing the waters within and adjacent to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay?
• Do humpback whales exhibit site-fidelity over periods of days to years?
• Do humpback whales congregate in specific high-traffic and/or high-use U.S. Navy training areas?
• Do humpback whales spend significant time within or move through areas of U.S. Navy live-fire and MINEX training?

However, relatively little information exists on how numerous offshore species, including beaked whales and endangered fin and sperm whales utilize the waters of the VACAPES OPAREA near the continental shelf break habitat.
Recent aerial surveys by the Virginia Aquarium, University of North Carolina Wilmington, and HDR (HDR,
2010), as well as vessel surveys by HDR, suggest that baleen whales, sperm whales, and other deep
diving odontocetes may be more common to the area of interest than first thought. The objectives of this
study are to utilize a combination of techniques including 1) photo-ID and behavioral data collection to
provide baseline assessments of animal movement patterns, site-fidelity, habitat use, life-history, and
behavior; 2) biopsy sampling to identify individuals, determine foraging patterns, and assist in delineating
stock structure boundaries; 3) satellite-monitored tagging techniques to supplement photo-ID-based
studies by providing information on residency patterns and habitat use across longer time scales (weeks
to months).

The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) is a vulnerable mammal that presents low capacity for physiological thermoregulation and uses forests as thermal shelters. Here, we aim to provide reliable estimates of giant anteaters’ movement patterns and home range size, as well as untangle the role of intrinsic and environmental drivers on their movement. We GPS-tracked 19 giant anteaters in Brazilian savannah. We used a continuous-time movement model to estimate their movement patterns (described by home range crossing time, daily distance moved and directionality), and provide an autocorrelated kernel density estimate of home range size. Then, we used mixed structural equations to integratively model the effects of sex, body mass and proportion of forest cover on movement patterns and home range size, considering the complex net of interactions between these variables. Male giant anteaters presented more intensive space use and larger home range than females with similar body mass, as it is expected in polygynous social mating systems. Males and females increased home range size with increasing body mass, but the allometric scaling of intensity of space use was negative for males and positive for females, indicating different strategies in search for resources. With decreasing proportion of forest cover inside their home ranges, and, consequently, decreasing thermal quality of their habitat, giant anteaters increased home range size, possibly to maximize the chances of accessing thermal shelters. As frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and deforestation are increasing, effective management efforts need to consider the role of forests as an important thermal resource driving spatial requirements of this species. We highlight that both intrinsic and environmental drivers of animal movement should be integrated to better guide management strategies.

In order to investigate the nature of the cues exploited for oceanic navigation, Cory’s shearwaters, Calonectris borealis, nesting in the Azores were displaced and released in open ocean at about 800 km from their colony, after being subjected to sensory manipulation. While magnetically disturbed shearwaters showed unaltered navigational performance and behaved similarly to unmanipulated control birds, the shearwaters deprived of their sense of smell were dramatically impaired in orientation and homing.

This foraging strategy makes the penguins particularly susceptible to set net operations that go after dogfish or school shark at the seafloor. Yellow-eyed penguin numbers are currently in free fall all along the mainland with climate change and fisheries interactions being suspected to play an important role in the current trends. However, the accurate assessment of fisheries impacts is hampered by a lack of data of the penguins’ utilization of the marine habitat. While some tracking work has been conducted in the past few years, our understanding of the penguins’ foraging ranges throughout the year is extremely limited. In some regions, we have no idea where the penguins go to find food and whether their home ranges overlap with commercial set net fisheries.

They tend to move in ways generally influenced by biotic and abiotic factors, respectively. However, few studies have explored the foraging behaviour of goats in the absence of predation and human disturbance. Based on step selection function modelling framework, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, vegetation surveys, and Global Positioning System tracking of 124 free-ranging domestic adult male Zhongwei goats over one year (2016–2017) were used to assess how biotic and abiotic environmental factors affected their spatiotemporal distribution, and developed a conceptual model to represent the goats’ trade-off between forage quantity and preference at different seasons, in the semi-arid grassland of Loess Plateau of 1 178 hectare. The results showed that spatial distributions of goats responded to spatiotemporal variation of biotic factors rather than abiotic factors of elevation, slope and solar radiation, which indicated that biotic factors were of priority to abiotic factors in the foraging process for the goats. According to the season changing, the goats positively used areas with higher forage quantity in the spring and winter, areas of higher forage quantity and preferred species in summer, and areas of abundance of preferred species in autumn. We developed a model to describe the phenomenon that the goats selected areas with higher preferred species only when the forage quantity was plentiful, otherwise they selected areas with higher forage quantity. Better understanding of the patterns and drivers of spatiotemporal distribution of the goats can improve our ability to predict foraging behaviour of livestock in heterogeneous environment and lead to better management practices and policies for the sustainability of these semi-arid landscapes and associated ecosystem services.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",,,,,"GPS","chenghua18@outlook.com (Hua Cheng)"

The North American race (N.p. hudsonicus) includes two disjunct breeding populations, both of which winter primarily in Central and South America. The western population breeds in Alaska and the Northwest Territories of Canada. The eastern population breeds south and west of Hudson Bay in Manitoba and Ontario. The prevailing idea was that the western population followed a Pacific Coast migration route between breeding and wintering areas in Panama and western South America, and that the Hudson Bay population followed an Atlantic Coast migration route to wintering grounds in Northeast South America. Both populations are of high conservation concern due to population declines in recent decades. Investigations into the migration routes of whimbrels staging in Virginia have shown a previously unknown link between the eastern and western populations as they stop-over in Virginia. The primary objective of this project is to examine the stop-over and migration strategies of whimbrels, as they relate to the conservation of the species.

The objectives of this research are to identify distinctive grazing personalities in Hereford beef cattle and to test for genotype-to-phenotype associations of grazing behaviors. The approach proposes to take advantage of the natural and distinctive grazing personalities displayed by domesticated livestock; thus, rangelands’ health can be enhanced and the negative environmental impact of free-range livestock systems is reduced.
I am searching for cattle herds that explore and use the whole landscape using the individual differences on grazing behaviors of domesticated herbivores. By spreading livestock grazing pressure across grazing lands and minimizing the use of naturally rare and fragile areas such low herbaceous plant communities, free-range livestock systems enhance grassland functions and services and reduce negative impact of the environment. Using GPS-tracking collars and satellite image data, I observed the grazing behavior of Hereford beef cattle in a few farms in Canterbury, New Zealand.
For this project, I built 120 GPS-tracking collars outfitted with long-lasting batteries and large data storage capacity. During the first year, I conducted a longitudinal behavioral sampling by collaring fewer cows (ca. 80) and by recording grazing behavior for relatively long periods (30 to 90 days). In the second year, I collared a much larger number of cows for shorter periods in a cross-sectional behavioral sampling.
I collected blood samples from all animals with behavioral data to investigate the genetic variation of ‘grazing-related genes’. They aim is to combine the grazing behavioral data with their corresponding genetic profile to seek for genotype-to-phenotype associations within the Hereford breed.

For avian migrants, these decisions can be affected by environmental and anthropogenic factors and by internal states. However, recent reviews have pointed to multiple gaps in our understanding of these decisions. We studied the decisions made by migrating endangered Steppe eagles Aquila nipalensis by tracking individuals for up to seven years with GPS transmitters. We used weather re-analysis models and high-resolution remote sensing to obtain environmental and anthropogenic information. Using complementary statistical methods, we differentiated between two behavioral states: migratory flights and stopover, and studied how different factors shape the birds' movements and the transition between the states. Most prominently, we detected effects of experience on the birds' response to anthropogenic habitats, with juvenile eagles drawn to them, adults avoiding them, and sub-adults showing no preference. Experience also affected the choice of tailwind and flight direction during migration, with juvenile individuals choosing stronger winds and more direct routes than more experienced eagles. During stopover, experienced eagles flew greater distances than less experienced eagles, and during both stopover and migratory periods, stronger tailwinds increased the distance birds moved. Finally, winds blowing towards the migratory direction increased the probability that a bird would initiate migration after a stopover, while opposite winds had the opposite effect. Our results advance our understanding of the ontogeny of bird migration and the effects of environmental and anthropogenic factors on migratory decision-making, with implications for the conservation of migratory species.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2018-09-20 02:28:05.000,2024-12-31 17:09:28.000,517997,"Aquila nipalensis","GPS","RonEfrat (Ron Efrat)"

It commences when a juvenile departs from its natal site and concludes when it settles to breed for the first time. During this interim period, dispersing individuals of long-lived species often undergo a wandering phase, which may span years. This phase remains one of the least studied aspects of avian life histories. We utilized a unique GPS-telemetry data set on a slow reproducing, long-lived migratory bird of prey, the European honey buzzard, Pernis apivorus, tracked for up to 6 years after fledging. Our aim was to assess how phenology, ranging behaviour and philopatry change as individuals gain experience. Individuals exhibited variability in the age at which they first returned to their breeding range, yet all survivors settled at sites proximate to their natal nests. In subsequent returns, immatures increased the time spent within the breeding range and narrowed down their ranging to smaller areas situated progressively closer to their natal nests.

Twenty-seven PTTs provided tracking data after birds departed their capture areas. After the breeding season murrelets migrated toward the Bering Sea, with short periods of movement (median 2 d) separated by short stopovers (median 1 d). During movements, travel averaged 79.4 km d-1 (83.5 SD, 449.1 maximum). All five Kittlitz’s Murrelets tagged in Prince William Sound in May 2011 were tracked to the Bering Sea by August and four subsequently continued north to the Chukchi and Beaufort seas (Arctic Ocean), accumulating total movement distances of 2500–4000 km. Many birds spent 2-3 weeks with little movement along coasts of the Alaska Peninsula or eastern Bering Sea during late August through September, which corresponds to the pre-basic molt period.

Fenced reserves from which invasive predators are removed are increasingly used as a conservation management tool, because they provide safe havens for susceptible threatened species, and create dense populations of native wildlife that could act as a source population for recolonising the surrounding landscape. However, the latter effect might also act as a food source, and promote high densities of invasive predators on the edges of such reserves. Aims. Our study aimed to determine whether activity ofthe feral cat is greater around the edges ofa fenced conservation
reserve, Arid Recovery, in northern South Australia. This reserve has abundant native rodents that move through the fence into the surrounding landscape. Methods. We investigated (1) whether feral cats were increasingly likely to be detected on track transects closer to the
fence over time as populations ofnative rodents increased inside the reserve, (2) whether native rodents were more likely to be found in the stomachs ofcats caught close to the reserve edge, and (3) whether individual cats selectively hunted on the reserve fence compared with two other similar fences, on the basis ofGPS movement data. Key results. We found that (1) detection rates of feral cats on the edges of a fenced reserve increased through time as populations of native rodents increased inside the reserve, (2) native rodents were far more likely to be found in the stomach ofcats collected at the reserve edge than in the stomachs ofcats far from the reserve edge, and (3) GPS tracking of cat movements showed a selection for the reserve fence edge, but not for similar fences away from the reserve. Conclusions. Invasive predators such as feral cats are able to focus their movements and activity to where prey availability is greatest, including the edges offenced conservation reserves. This limits the capacity ofreserves to function as source areas from which animals can recolonise the surrounding landscape, and increases predation pressure on populations of other species living on the reserve edge. Implications. Managers offenced conservation reserves should be aware that increased predator control may be critical
for offsetting the elevated impacts of feral cats attracted to the reserve fence.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",,,,,"GPS","hmcgregor104 (Hugh McGregor)"

A species that feeds on a wide variety of prey types (i.e. generalist diet) may be comprised of generalist individuals, specialist individuals that feed on different prey types, or a combination of the two. If individuals within a population respond differently to an environmental change, population-level responses may not be detectable. By tracking foraging movements of great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus), a generalist species, we compared group-level and individual-level responses to an increase in prey biomass (capelin; Mallotus villosus) during the breeding season in coastal Newfoundland, Canada. As hypothesized, shifts in prey availability resulted in significantly different individual responses in foraging behaviour and space use, which was not detectable when data from individuals were combined. Some individuals maintained similar foraging areas, foraging trip characteristics (e.g., trip length, duration) and habitat use with increased capelin availability, while others shifted foraging areas and habitats resulting in either increased or decreased trip characteristics. We show that individual specialization can be non-contextual in some gulls, whereby these individuals continuously use the same feeding strategy despite significant change in prey availability conditions. Findings also indicate high response diversity among individuals to shifting prey conditions that a population- or group-level study would not have detected, emphasizing the importance of examining individual-level strategies for future diet and foraging studies on generalist species.

The H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, traditionally associated with poultry farms, has been expanding throughout the world, infecting wild birds and mammals. In the winter of 2021/22, the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b killed thousands of common cranes (Grus grus) at the Hula Valley (Israel), one of the first major hotspots of the ongoing global outbreak. Here, we present a general framework for managing pathogen outbreaks using animal movement and acceleration-sensing biologging data, and demonstrate its application to a recent outbreak. Data from GPS-tracked cranes allowed early assessment of outbreak magnitude, well before the mass mortality occurred. Biologging data also provided real-time information on individual’s health and population mortality rates, and on the proportion, location, and typical timescale of infected, uninfected, dead, dying and recovering individuals. Furthermore, combining past and ongoing biologging data can provide early alerts on emerging outbreaks, and help assess patterns of potential spread at local to global scales. We suggest further use of near-real-time biologging for forecasting and managing disease outbreaks, and for other environmental management purposes such as mitigating wildlife morality by wind turbines or poisoning.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2016-01-01 04:12:00.000,2022-03-14 07:02:00.000,154067,,"GPS","Idan.Talmon (Idan Talmon)"

If extensive pollinator movement is part of their normal routine, it could allow plants the bees pollinate to be rare and occur in widely scattered locations. However the absence of movement data from solitary bees presents a formidable challenge to quantitative prediction. Here we use micro radio telemetry to show that individual male orchid bees (Exaerete frontalis) habitually use large areas (at least 42 – 115 ha) on a daily basis. Aerial telemetry located individuals up to 5 km away from core ranges. When following individual bees we found them to be stationary for variable lengths of time and then fly to a new site where again they remained stationary. In addition our data suggest a bimodal frequency distribution of home range sizes. We propose individuals either use multiple widely-separated core areas or have a central core with an extremely large periphery where they gather resources. We suggest that the large distances habitually travelled by the orchid bees have important implications for explaining orchid diversity and plant evolution.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2007-03-02 16:00:00.000,2007-03-11 01:30:00.000,111,"Exaerete frontalis","GPS,Radio Transmitter","Rolandisimo (Roland Kays)"

energy expenditure in wild animals is challenging. Accelerometers
are commonly used to estimate energy expenditure, via a dynamic
body acceleration (DBA) or time–energy budget approach. The DBA
approach estimates energy expenditure directly from acceleration but
may lead to erroneous estimates during inactivity when acceleration
is zero but energy expenditure is not. The time–energy budget
approach uses accelerometers and other data streams to assign a
behaviour to each time step, and then calculates energy expenditure
based on activity-specific metabolic rates assigned to each
behaviour. Here, we used GPS-accelerometry in breeding blacklegged
kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla, n=80) to calculate DBA and time–
energy budgets derived from simple biologging metrics (speed,
wingbeat frequency, GPS position). We then compared these two
approaches with estimates of energy expenditure from doubly
labelled water (DLW). Energy expenditure estimated from DLW
correlated with DBA, but the best model to estimate energy
expenditure was based on time–energy budgets. Energetic costs of
flapping flight were higher than all other kittiwake behaviours
(5.54×basal metabolic rate, BMR). Energetic costs of gliding flight
(0.80×BMR) were the lowest of all behaviours, and equivalent to the
cost of resting at the colony. DEE for our birds estimated from our
calibration coefficients was similar to DEE for our birds estimated with
the model coefficient published using different methods.We conclude
that once calibrated with DLW, GPS-accelerometry provides a simple
method for measuring energy expenditure in wild kittiwakes based on
time–energy budgets.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",,,,,,"FredTremblay (Fred Tremblay)"

However, inappropriate payload distribution is critical in aircraft and, since birds and planes are subject to the same laws of physics during flight, we considered aircraft aerodynamic constraints to explain flight patterns displayed by northern gannets Sula bassana equipped with (small ca. 14 g) tail- and back-mounted accelerometers and (larger ca.  30 g) tail-mounted GPS units. Tail-mounted GPS-fitted birds showed significantly higher cumulative numbers of flap-glide cycles and a higher pitch angle of the tail than accelerometer-equipped birds, indicating problems with balancing inappropriately placed weights with knock-on consequences relating to energy expenditure.

Burnham)","Although the Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica is well studied throughout its temperate and low Arctic breeding range, few have studied the species in its far northern distribution.  This study is the first to present data on the migratory movements of the “large-billed” subspecies, F. a. naumanni, that breeds in the high Arctic and which has significantly larger body size than those farther south.  During 2013–2015, migration tracks were collected from nine adult puffins (6 males and 3 females) tagged with geolocators in northwest Greenland.  Overall, female puffins traveled farther than males on their annual migration, with one female puffin traveling over 13,600 km, which was nearly a third farther than any tagged male in our study.  Differential migration was observed in migratory phenology and route, with males using a form of chain migration with acute synchrony between individuals while females appeared to largely use leap-frog migration and showed little synchrony between individuals.  Extreme sexual segregation in wintering areas was evidenced by two females that migrated to the southern limit of the species range while the six males remained at the northern limit, and wintered along the sea ice edge during portions of the non-breeding season.  Male puffins thus wintered in regions with sea surface temperatures up to 10° C cooler than female puffins, and in areas with generally colder sea surface temperatures when compared to previously known wintering areas of temperate and low Arctic puffin breeding populations.  The degree to which body size enables male F. a. naumanni to remain in colder waters likely reflects differing life history constraints between sexes and populations (i.e., subspecies).  Further study is warranted to investigate how recent changes in climate have further exacerbated the observed differences between sexes in high Arctic puffins and possibly other marine avian species.

We then followed their movements using bird-borne GPS transmitters throughout the treatment season as well as the following annual cycle and compared them to the movements of tracked gulls whose nests were not oiled, while also accounting for individual and temporal factors known to influence movement patterns including sex, body size, and breeding stage. Gulls with oiled nests had smaller breeding-season home ranges, spent more time at breeding sites, made fewer foraging trips, and traveled shorter distances than gulls with non-oiled nests during the treatment season but not during the following breeding season. Gulls were partially migratory, with individuals showing a variety of migratory strategies from year-round residency to long-distance migration to inland urban centers. Although egg-oiling delayed the onset of post-breeding migration, individual migration strategies remaining consistent between years regardless of treatment. Antibody titres against three common pathogens varied among pathogens but not by migration distances or individual characteristics. Our results show that induced breeding failure via egg-oiling may have unintended short-term consequences including smaller home range areas, altered habitat use, delayed migration, and longer breeding-site residency, suggesting that management actions aimed to reduce breeding success could increase opportunities for human-wildlife conflict and spread of spatially heterogeneous pathogens at local scales. At the landscape scale, the migration patterns and wintering distribution of yellow-legged gulls are unlikely to be affected by egg-oiling. However, long-distance inland migrations of a portion of the population present a novel pathway for pathogen transmission between and among marine habitats and terrestrial human, livestock, and wildlife populations.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2021-04-15 16:56:06.000,2023-12-04 13:19:42.000,2955025,,"GPS","jslamb (Juliet S Lamb)"

Understanding variation in HR provides important insights into underlying ecological processes driving space use, contributing to species management and conservation. HR is widely known to increase allometrically at an interspecific level. However, it remains unclear whether the interspecific allometric scaling of mammals’ HR can also be consistently observed within species. Additionally, the influence of sex-specific metabolic and behavioral patterns on intraspecific variation in both HR and HR scaling is not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we GPS-tracked 475 individuals across Brazil, encompassing 18 mammal species. We estimated individuals’ HR and modeled intraspecific variation in HR against body mass and sex, while controlling for habitat quality and phylogenetic relationships. Males used larger areas and displayed steeper HR scaling than females. While males showed a positive allometric scaling similar to interspecific findings reported in the literature (exponent = 1.23), females’ body mass had no statistically discernible effect on HR. Our findings suggest that sex-related metabolic and behavioral traits influence space use across mammals. In general, males have greater energetic and evolutionary incentives to expand their HR with increasing BM, as well as more physical capacity to do so, compared to females. We highlight that traditional studies on HR and, especially, HR scaling that disregard individual sex may, in reality, reflect an average of two distinct patterns, while failing to accurately represent either one.","research",true,true,false,false,false,"na",,,,,,"aline.giroux (Aline da Silva Giroux)"

Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25–43.53 ha) within one or a few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e.g. trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also observed long (i.e. .45 min) resting periods between flights (B. hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on the insects.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2009-06-29 11:00:00.000,2009-07-05 09:30:00.000,116,"Animalia ","Radio Transmitter","kissling (Daniel Kissling)"

Sex and age bias in turbine collisions can exacerbate these impacts through demographic changes that can lead to population decline or collapse. While several studies have reported sex and age differences in the number of soaring birds killed by turbines, it remains unclear if they result from different abundances or group-specific turbine avoidance behaviours, the latter having severer consequences. We investigated sex and age effects on turbine avoidance behaviour of black kites (Milvus migrans) during migration near the Strait of Gibraltar. We tracked the movements of 135 individuals with GPS data loggers in an area with high density of turbines and then modelled the effect of proximity of turbines on bird utilization distribution (UD). Both sexes and age classes showed similar patterns of displacement, with reduced UD values in the proximity of turbines and a clear peak at 700–850 m away, probably marking the distance at which most birds turn direction to avoid approaching the turbines further. The consistency of these patterns indicates that displacement range can be used as an accurate proxy for collision risk and habitat loss, and should be incorporated in environmental impact assessment studies.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2012-08-09 12:10:24.000,2013-09-11 09:06:15.000,231193,"Milvus migrans","GPS","cdsantos"

Burnham)","Peregrine Falcons, Falco peregrinus tundrius, were historically unknown to Inuit and early explorers in the Pituffik (Thule) area, northwest Greenland (75.90–77.60° N). Here we provide information collected from 1993–2005 on what we believe is a recently established and expanding population of High Arctic nesting Peregrines in the area associated with climate change. From 1979 to 2005, the average of the mean monthly temperature, minimum monthly temperature, and maximum monthly temperature for the five-month period, May through September, increased 1.1, 0.5, and 1.6 °C, respectively. Forty-one breeding attempts were recorded at six sites from 1993 to 2005 for this new population. Satellite transmitters were used to determine the home ranges and seasonal movements of female Peregrines, with adults traveling an average of 10,794 km at a rate of 205 km/day on outward migration. During outward migration, the maximum distance traveled by any female on one day was 1,349 km with the maximum total outward and return migrations for single individuals 12,438 and 11,071 km, respectively, to and from south America. Comparisons with Peregrine populations in Greenland at 67° N and 60.5° N, approximately 1,100 (Kangerlussuaq) and 1,700 (south Greenland) km south of the Pituffik area, respectively, show differences in various aspects of ecology. Based on a lack of both morphological and genetic differences it appears the Pituffik area population is likely a result of the extension of more southern breeding Peregrines moving north and taking advantage of an ameliorating climate and lengthened breeding window. Should climatic amelioration continue, the species may eventually expand its range into the very northernmost land area, Peary Land.

During migration, rufa Red Knots rest and refuel at stopover sites along the Atlantic Coast of the USA, including Kiawah and Seabrook islands in South Carolina. We document the importance of Kiawah and Seabrook islands forknots during their spring migration using on-the-ground surveys between 19 February and 20 May 2021 to record the occurrence and proportion of individually marked knots, as well as geolocators deployed on knots captured in the area. Using a superpopulation model, we estimated a minimum passage population of 17,247 knots (95% CI: 13,548–22,099; ~41% of the total rufa knot population) and an average stopover duration of 47 days (95% CI: 40.1–54.8). Our geolocator results showed that knots using Kiawah and Seabrook islands can bypass Delaware Bay and fly directly to the Canadian Arctic. Finally, our geolocators, combined with resighting data from across the Atlantic Flyway, indicate that a large network of more than 70 coastal sites concentrated largely in the southeastern USA provide stopover and overwintering habitat for the knots we observed on Kiawah and Seabrook islands. These findings show that Kiawah and Seabrook islands should be recognized as critical sites in the knot network and, therefore, a conservation priority. The threats facing these sites, such as prey depletion, anthropogenic disturbance, and sea level rise, require immediate attention.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",,,,"Calidris canutus","Solar Geolocator Raw","HUGOMigrate (Nathan Senner)"

We assessed the importance of different landscape elements (open sea, tidal flats and inland) by comparing marine and terrestrial foraging behaviours in lesser black-backed gulls breeding along the coast of the southern North Sea. We attached GPS data loggers to eight incubating birds and collected information on diet and habitat use. The loggers recorded data for 10–19 days to allow flight-path reconstruction. Lesser black-backed gulls foraged in both offshore and inland areas, but rarely on tidal flats. Targets and directions were similar among all eight individuals. Foraging trips (n = 108) lasted 0.5–26.4 h (mean 8.7 h), and ranges varied from 3.0–79.9 km (mean 30.9 km). The total distance travelled per foraging trip ranged from 7.5–333.6 km (mean 97.9 km). Trips out to sea were significantly more variable in all parameters than inland trips. Presence in inland areas was closely associated with daylight, whereas trips to sea occurred at day and night, but mostly at night. The most common items in pellets were grass (48%), insects (38%), fish (28%), litter (26%) and earthworms (20%). There was a significant relationship between the carbon and nitrogen isotope signals in blood and the proportional time each individual spent foraging at sea/land. On land, gulls preferentially foraged on bare ground, with significantly higher use of potato fields and significantly less use of grassland. The flight patterns of lesser black-backed gulls at sea overlapped with fishing-vessel distribution, including small beam trawlers fishing for shrimps in coastal waters close to the colony and large beam-trawlers fishing for flatfish at greater distances. Our data show that individuals made intensive use of the anthropogenic landscape and seascape, indicating that lesser black-backed gulls are not a predominantly marine species during the incubation period.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2010-05-16 18:41:20.000,2010-06-04 14:33:02.000,49617,"Larus fuscus","GPS","stefangarthe (Stefan Garthe)"

areas, is widespread in nature, and likely benefits individuals through higher foraging
efficiency and potentially, higher breeding success. It may arise as a consequence of
habitat or resource specialisation, or alternatively, where resources are abundant or
predictable, the partitioning of space might guarantee individuals exclusive foraging
opportunities. We tracked seven adult great black-backed gulls Larus marinus at a
North Sea colony from early incubation to the end of the breeding season in 2016,
providing a total of 1170 foraging trips over a mean ± SD tracking period of 67 ± 16
days. There was clear spatial segregation between individuals, with almost no overlap
of their core areas (50% utilisation distribution) during incubation and chickrearing.
Core areas were relatively small and there was high repeatability (R ± SE) in
foraging parameters, including initial departure direction (0.73 ± 0.11), foraging range
(0.41 ± 0.14) and cumulative distance travelled (0.19 ± 0.1) throughout the breeding
season. Despite the low spatial overlap, there was little evidence of differential habitat
use by individuals. The near-exclusive individual foraging areas of this species, usually
considered to be a generalist, indicate that where there is high resource availability
throughout the breeding season and a small local population, individuals appear to
adopt a territorial strategy which likely reduces intraspecific competition.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2016-05-01 00:03:32.000,2016-07-15 23:59:45.000,275521,"Larus marinus","GPS","stefangarthe (Stefan Garthe)"

Estas 5 tortugas, de entre 7 y 8 años de edad, fueron criadas en cautividad desde su nacimiento en las instalaciones del Cabildo Insular de Fuerteventura (Centro de conservación y recuperación de tortugas marinas de Morro Jable) y de la ULPGC en Taliarte, Gran Canaria. Serán monitorizadas mediante transmisores de seguimiento por satélite tras ser liberadas en la playa de Cofete, Fuerteventura, lugar de nacimiento de la mayoría de los ejemplares y área principal del programa de reintroducción de esta especie en Canarias. El objetivo de esta actividad es identificar los tipos de hábitats que usarán tras su liberación, localizar su área de distribución, e identificar rutas migratorias en caso de que llegaran a migrar.

Exacerbating this problem is the fact that many species are extremely difficult to detect outside of breeding. Here, we demonstrate a partial solution to this problem by using archival GPS tags to examine the overwintering ecology of a migratory nocturnal bird, the eastern whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferous). We deployed tags on 21 individuals and were able to recover 11 (52%) one year later. Tags collected high precision (approx. 10m) points throughout the nonbreeding period. With continuous time movement models, we used these data to estimate overwintering home ranges. All individuals exhibited at least one bounded home range during this phase of the annual cycle, three of eleven had two wintering locations, and home range area ranged from 0.50–10.85ha. All overwintering home ranges contained closed-canopy forest land cover (42-100%), and no other land cover type represented >40% of any home range.  We found some evidence, with caveats, that total edge within the landscape surrounding the home range was negatively related to home range area. The prevalence of contiguous closed-canopy forest cover in overwintering home ranges contrasts with apparent breeding habitat preferences, which includes clear cuts and other, more open, habitats. This study is the first to reveal key aspects of overwintering space use in this species by using archival GPS to overcome both logistical and methodological limitations. Expanded use of such technology is critical to gathering basic ecological and distributional data, necessary for achieving a more complete understanding of full annual cycles of animal populations.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2017-10-02 02:54:00.000,2018-03-25 02:50:00.000,296,"Antrostomus vociferus","GPS","chris_tonra (Christopher Tonra)"

Aspects of spatial memory and perception likely combine to support the now well-documented ability of homing pigeons to learn to retrace the same route when homing from familiar locations, leading to the prediction that damage to the HF would result in a diminished ability to repeatedly fly a similar route home. HF-lesioned homing pigeons were repeatedly released from three sites to assess the importance of the hippocampus as pigeons gradually learn a familiar route home guided by familiar landmark and landscape features. As expected, control pigeons displayed increasing fidelity to a familiar route home, and by inference, successful perceptual and memory processing of familiar landmarks/landscape features. By contrast, the impoverished route fidelity of the HF-lesioned pigeons indicated an impaired sensitivity to the same landmark/landscape features.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2018-07-06 06:22:29.000,2018-07-31 13:38:23.000,1825482,"Columba livia","GPS","anna (Anna Gagliardo)"

Human habitation can influence desert ecosystems directly through changes in land use and indirectly through the introduction of
alien species that compete with locally adapted fauna. Native species can respond to these processes by spatial or temporal avoidance. Ruppell’s fox is a desert-adapted species inhabiting
flat, rocky arid areas that feeds mainly on invertebrates and rodents. We used location data and step selection functions to study the space use of a population in southern Israel. We hypothesized that Ruppell’s fox movement would be influenced by topography due to
preference for creeks, where insects and rodents are available, and by human infrastructure as the presence of humans, vehicles and associated animals may induce a fear effect on native species. Ruppell’s fox habitat selection was seasonal. During the dry season, foxes showed preference for flatter areas and creek bottoms and avoided paved roads. During the rainy season, foxes avoided less- trafficked dirt roads. These patterns were likely a consequence of increased territoriality due to denning in the colder season and reduced availability of insects in the dry season. Avoidance of paved and dirt roads may be explained by fear of human presence and perception of risk due to the use of linear features by larger
carnivores, such as wolves and red foxes. Our results suggest that current protected, remote and uninhabited areas have an elevated value for the persistence of Ruppell’s fox populations. We recommend limitation of vehicle movement within current reserves and continued monitoring of population trends for this little studied carnivore.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",,,,"Vulpes rueppellii",,"adibarocas (Adi Barocas)"

Worldwide, there is only one (!) Individuals left in the Middle East showing the species-specific migratory behavior. Apart of this individual, only some wild and semi-wild sedentary free-flying colonies and several zoo colonies are remaining. 

For 10 years, the Waldrappteam and its partners particular aim is to preserve the NBI as a migratory species from extinction, by creating new Migration traditions with descendants of European Zoo-Populations. A first migratory colony could be established. The birds breed in Burghausen/Bavaria and winter in the WWF Oasi Laguna di Orbetello/Tuscany. 

In 2014 a project, co-financed by the European Commission (LIFE+), starts. It aims to establish three migratory NBI colonies in Europe, with breeding areas north of the Alps and a common migration tradition to a wintering area in the southern Tuscany/Italy. 

All birds are equipped with GPS tags. The major aim for tagging is to implement actions against illegal hunting in Italy, the major threat for the free-flying birds. Two birds are currently tagged with solar-tags provided by the MPIAB. Our aim for the near future is to publish the majority of track via Movebank. 

The migration corridor ranges from Bavaria to the southern Tuscany, directly across the Alps and the Apennine. Major movements of adult birds along the migration corridor occur during the migration periods, which last from April till May (spring) resp. from August till October (autumn). Juvenile and sub-adult NBIs fly in the range of the migration corridor from April till October.

However, few studies have tried to validate the significance of these three concepts simultaneously, and long-term, high-resolution tagging datasets recording individual movements across consecutive years are scarce. We used such a dataset to explore intraspecific and intra-individual variabilities in departure and arrival decisions from/to wintering grounds in relation to these three different concepts in bird migration.

Methods: We equipped 23 curlews (Numenius arquata) wintering in the Wadden Sea with Global Positioning System data loggers to record their spatio-temporal patterns of departure from and arrival at their wintering site, and the first part of their spring migration. We obtained data for 42 migrations over 6 years, with 12 individuals performing repeat migrations in consecutive years. Day of year of departure and arrival was related to 38 meteorological and bird-related predictors using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify drivers of departure and arrival decisions.

Results: Curlews migrated almost exclusively to Arctic and sub-Arctic Russia for breeding. They left their wintering site mainly during the evening from mid- to late April and returned between the end of June and mid-July. There was no difference in departure times between the sexes. Weather parameters did not impact departure decisions; if departure days coincided with headwind conditions, the birds accounted for this by flying at higher altitudes of up to several kilometres. Curlews breeding further away in areas with late snowmelt departed later. Departures dates varied by only <4 days in individual curlews tagged over consecutive years.

Conclusions: These results suggest that the trigger for migration in this long-distance migrant is largely independent of weather conditions but is subject to resource availability in breeding areas. The high intra-individual repeatability of departure days among subsequent years and the lack of relationship to weather parameters suggest the importance of genetic triggers in prompting the start of migration. Further insights into the timing of migration in immatures and closely related birds might help to further unravel the genetic mechanisms triggering migration patterns.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2014-04-01 00:00:00.000,2020-07-31 23:59:44.000,801488,"Numenius arquata","GPS","Philipp Schwemmer (Philipp Schwemmer)"

Natural populations are not homogenous systems, but sets of individuals that use subsets of the species’ niche. This phenomenon is known as individual specialization. Recently, several studies found evidence of individual specialization, mainly among animals. Although diet and use of space are intrinsically connected to one another, studies on individual specialization have seldom assessed the latter.
2. Our goal is to help fill this gap in knowledge by testing individual specialization using yellow–shouldered bats (Sturnira lilium) as a model and the new movement ecology paradigm as a framework.
3. First, we modeled as a network a system formed by individual bats and the landscape elements used by them. Second, to calculate overlap in individual activity areas as a proxy for specialization we developed a novel metric, the spatial individual specialization index (SpatIS). Finally, we tested fruit availability as a driver of interindividual differences in use of space. Ten individual bats were radio tracked in a heterogeneous Brazilian savanna. The density of their main food–plants was estimated and the number of activity points of each individual was counted.
4. There was large interindividual variation in the use of space not explained by sex or weight. Thus, our results point to individual specialization in the use of space in the studied population of S. lilium, which seems to be linked to food–plant distribution.
5. We conclude that individual specialization may affect the way a frugivore moves in space, with direct consequences for seed dispersal and landscape connectivity.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2009-07-11 15:00:00.000,2010-08-07 00:25:00.000,744,"Sturnira lilium","Radio Transmitter","parogeri (Patricia Kerches-Rogeri)"

These migratory strategies may expose individuals to different threats, thus understanding migratory connectivity is crucial to assess risks to populations. Glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) are generalist predators with flexible migratory behaviour that may alter these behaviours in response to climate change and anthropogenic activities, such as access to landfills, yet little is known about their migration. We deployed GPS and GLS tracking devices on glaucous gulls from Coats Island, Nunavut, Canada to obtain the first insights into their migration and habitat use in the Canadian Arctic. Gulls used two migration strategies during the non-breeding season, where one migrated as far as the Sea of Okhotsk in the Pacific and the remainder (n = 7) wintered in the North Atlantic. Gulls primarily overwintered in pelagic (56%) and coastal (38%) habitats. While in coastal habitats, one gull visited one landfill once, but visits increased with a 1 km and 3 km buffer, suggesting that urban glaucous gulls primarily used non-landfill habitats. This research can be used as a baseline to explore changes in migratory behaviour and inform future conservation of Arctic-breeding gulls.

Nevertheless, anosmic pigeons, Columba livia, show unimpaired navigation when released within a familiar area, suggesting that they may rely on familiar visual landmarks for navigation. However, direct evidence for the reliance on familiar visual landmarks during homing in anosmic birds has never been provided. In this study we tracked pigeons subjected singly to one training flight from each of three locations. Prior to their second release from each site, half of the birds were made anosmic while the others were not manipulated. The level of route fidelity was analysed separately for three phases of the homing process, in which familiar visual cues may have different relevance and may be used within different cognitive strategies: (1) ‘Initial decision making’; (2) ‘En route navigation’; (3) ‘Local navigation around home’. Compared to control birds, the anosmic birds flew significantly closer to previously overflown locations in the ‘En route navigation’ phase, while no difference in route fidelity emerged during phases (1) and (3). Our results showed that a single experience is sufficient for pigeons to learn release site features, and that familiar visual landmarks constitute a critical source of navigational information in olfactorily deprived birds during the homing process.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2017-07-05 07:36:42.000,2017-07-25 08:33:16.000,2541223,"Columba livia","GPS","anna (Anna Gagliardo)"

These parameters were modelled against wind speed and direction, time of the day, solar irradiance (proxy of thermal uplift), starting altitude and distance to Morocco, and age and sex of birds. We found that sea crossing performance of black kites is driven by their age, the wind conditions, the starting altitude and the starting distance to Morocco. Young birds assumed more risks than adults by making longer sea crossings and reaching lower altitude above the sea. Crosswinds promoted longer sea crossings, with birds reaching lower altitudes and with higher flapping effort. Birds starting at lower altitudes were more likely to quit or made higher flapping effort to complete the sea crossing. The location where the birds started the sea crossings impacted crossing distance and duration.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2012-08-09 10:59:42.000,2013-09-06 15:26:03.000,27630,"Milvus migrans","GPS","cdsantos"

Documenting movements and identifying areas used by raptors before they enter a breeding population is important for understanding the factors that influence their survival. In North America, juvenile Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) are routinely observed outside the species’ breeding range during the nonbreeding season, but the natal origins of these birds are rarely known. We used satellite telemetry to track the movements of juvenile Gyrfalcons during their first months of independence. We instrumented nestlings with lightweight satellite transmitters within 10 d of estimated fledging dates on the Seward Peninsula in western Alaska and in Denali National Park (Denali) in interior Alaska. Gyrfalcons spent an average of 41.4 6 6.1 d (range 5 30–50 d) in their natal areas after fledging. The mean departure date from natal areas was 27 August 6 6.4 d. We tracked 15 individuals for an average of 70.5 6 28.1 d post-departure; Gyrfalcons moved from 105 to 4299 km during this period and tended to move greater distances earlier in the tracking period than later in the tracking period. Gyrfalcons did not establish temporary winter ranges within the tracking period. We identified several movement patterns among Gyrfalcons, including unidirectional long-distance movements, multidirectional long- and short- distance movements, and shorter movements within a local region. Gyrfalcons from the Seward Peninsula remained in western Alaska or flew to eastern Russia with no movements into interior Alaska. In contrast, Gyrfalcons from Denali remained in interior Alaska, flew to northern and western Alaska, or flew to northern Alberta. Gyrfalcons from both study areas tended to move to coastal, riparian, and wetland areas during autumn and early winter. Because juvenile Gyrfalcons dispersed over a large geographic area and across three international boundaries, conservation efforts should focus on both regional and international scales.

The solution is to make use of the so-called thermals, which are localized, warmer regions in the atmosphere moving upwards with a speed exceeding the descent rate of bird and plane. Whereas birds use this technique mainly for foraging, humans do it as a sporting activity. Thermalling involves efficient optimization including the skillful localization of thermals, trying to guess the most favorable route, estimating the best descending rate, etc. In this study, we address the question whether there are any analogies between the solutions birds and humans find to handle the above task. High-resolution track logs were taken from thermalling falcons and paraglider pilots to determine the essential parameters of the flight patterns. We find that there are relevant common features in the ways birds and humans use thermals.

However, little is known about migratory movements and connectivity of shorebird populations. By identifying migratory stop-over and wintering areas, we can begin to identify sites that should be conserved and evaluate the relative risks of development and climate change scenarios. 

The primary objective of this study is to collect baseline information on movement patterns of Semipalmated Sandpipers during the post-breeding period so we can identify important migratory stop-over, breeding, and wintering locations; determine habitat selection patterns; determine migratory connectivity among geographic regions; estimate residency times at stop-over sites; and evaluate effects of future environmental change scenarios on shorebird use. 

In 2017, we equipped 68 Semipalmated Sandpipers at four Arctic-breeding locations (Canning River, Colville River, Prudhoe Bay, and Utqiagvik) with 1.2 g Pinpoint 10 GPS Swift tags (Lotek Wireless). These tags were programmed to collect 1 location every day from June 20 to September 15, then 1 location every three days from November 6 to March 23.

Few details are known about the annual cycle of this elusive species. We studied movements and breeding in water rails from southernmost Norway where the species occurs year‐round. Colour‐ringed wintering birds occurred only occasionally at the study site in summer, and vice versa. Geolocator tracks revealed that wintering birds (n = 10) migrated eastwards in spring to breed on both sides of the Baltic Sea, whereas a single breeding bird from the study site wintered in N Italy. Ambient light records of geolocator birds further indicated that all but one incubated 2–4 clutches per season. By combining information on incubation and movement, we found evidence for itinerant breeding in three individual birds: After a first breeding attempt (one did not incubate), all moved 129–721 km to breed again. This behaviour is rarely recorded in birds and was unexpected because the water rail is described as monogamous with both parents caring for eggs and chicks. The study greatly improves our knowledge about the annual cycle and reproduction in water rails. However, more studies are warranted to evaluate the generality of our findings and causes of breeding itinerancy.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2014-02-01 16:06:14.000,2016-03-28 18:20:14.000,173,"Rallus aquaticus","Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw","terje.lislevand (Terje Lislevand)"

Our understanding, however, of the strategies used in pursuit and evasion remains limited. Here we report on the hunting dynamics of the world’s fastest land animal, the cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus. Using miniaturized data loggers, we recorded fine-scale movement, speed and acceleration of free-ranging cheetahs to measure how hunting dynamics relate to chasing different sized prey. Cheetahs attained hunting speeds of up to 18.94 m/s and accelerated up to 7.5 m/s2 with greatest angular velocities achieved during the terminal phase of the hunt. The interplay between forward and lateral acceleration during chases showed that the total forces involved in speed changes and turning were approximately constant over time but varied with prey type. Thus, rather than a simple maximum speed chase, cheetahs first accelerate to decrease the distance to their prey, before reducing speed 5-8 s from the end of the hunt, so as to facilitate rapid turns to match prey escape tactics, varying the precise strategy according to prey species. Predator and prey thus pit a fine balance of speed against manoeuvring capability in a race for survival.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2012-02-09 05:16:02.000,2012-04-04 15:53:40.000,35308,"Acinonyx jubatus","GPS","johnnybirder (John W Wilson)"

The tracks were used in Lisovksi et al. 2021 to describe their migration pattern and compared them with optimal migration routes for wind and reseource availability. 

We found that in autumn, theoretical wind driven migration routes formed a broad-front corridor connecting Europe and the Indian Subcontinent while the theoretical resource driven routes formed a distinct north-south divide. The latter pattern was also reflected the rosefinch tracks with all but the most southerly breeding birds making a northern detour towards non-breeding sites in Pakistan and India. In spring, the resource availability model predicted a similar migratory divide, however, the southern route seemed relatively more favourable and closely matched with the optimal wind driven migration routes. Spring tracking data showed larger overlap with the modelled wind driven migration routes compared to the resource driven routes.

We conclude, that optimal wind and resource driven migration routes along the Indo-European flyway are seasonally specific and to a large extend do not overlap with one another. Under these conditions, migratory birds adopt seasonally distinct migration strategies following energy minimization strategy in autumn, driven by resource availability, and time minimizing strategy in spring, driven by wind conditions. Our optimal migration models can be applied worldwide and used to validate against empirical data to explain large-scale biogeographic pattern of migratory animals.

Individuals of subspecies leucorhoa thus wait for optimal flying conditions to resume for longer flights, while oenanthe birds, with shorter distances ahead, seem to optimise time by leaving the stopover site more quickly.

To describe woodcock migration patterns and phenology, we captured and equipped 73 woodcock with satellite tracking devices in the Central Management Region (analogous to the Mississippi Flyway) of North America and documented migration paths of 60 individual woodcock and 87 autumn or spring woodcock migrations during 2014–2016. Woodcock migration at the scale of the Central Management Region was more synchronous in spring than in autumn, but unlike most other migratory birds, average duration of autumn migration (31 days) was shorter than duration of spring migration (53 days). This difference in migration duration resulted from woodcock making more close-together migratory stopovers during spring migration, not because woodcock had individual stopovers of longer duration. During autumn migration, the number of days, the number of stopovers, migration end date and net migration displacement were negatively related to initiation date and rate of migration, and the number of stopovers and the net migration displacement were negatively related with migration end date. Spring migration duration, end date, the number of stopovers and net migration displacement were negatively related to migration rate and initiation date was positively related to migration rate, suggesting that woodcock that initiated spring migration later had faster migration rates. Juvenile female woodcock began spring migration later than adult female woodcock. Our results provide a basis for comparing current harvest seasons with presence of migrating woodcock during autumn and provide insight into differential harvest of migratory versus local woodcock on breeding areas.

A wide range of tools has been developed to repel animals from areas where they are suspected to cause damage. For waterfowl, direct comparisons of multiple repelling methods have so far focused only on species´ presence, total numbers, cost effectiveness or subsequent damage assessments, but not on individual behaviour.

Here, we investigated the individual responses of free-flying geese to three repelling methods using high-resolution tracking data. In an experimental setup, tracked individuals were repelled by human approach, gunshot sound or handheld lasers.

We found that repelling success and return time to the field where the repelling took place increased when individuals were repelled multiple times. Travel distances after the repelling events were longer after human approach and gunshot sound compared to the handheld laser treatments. In spring, the probability to return to the same field was higher after repelling with handheld lasers, but no difference between treatments was evident in autumn. We observed no increase in the probability to visit accommodation fields, where geese were allowed to forage and were not repelled, after the repelling events.

Synthesis and applications. We found no strong differences between the three methods regarding the repelling effectiveness and the resulting behaviour of the tracked geese. However, the higher return rates of individuals after repelling with handheld lasers in spring suggest that this method might be less effective in situations with bright sunlight or very large aggregations of geese. Apart from these limitations, we can recommend handheld lasers for repelling as they might reduce energetic losses for the geese and disturbance of non-target wildlife. Since repelling by gunshot sound and handheld lasers was twice as fast as repelling by human approach, those methods will reduce working hours by 50% and therefore be more cost-effective in practice.

GPS‐tracking devices have been used in combination with a wide range of additional sensors to study animal behaviour, physiology and interaction with their environment. Tri‐axial accelerometers allow researchers to remotely infer the behaviour of individuals, at all places and times. Collection of accelerometer data is relatively cheap in terms of energy usage, but the amount or raw data collected generally requires much storage space and is particularly demanding in terms of energy needed for data transmission.
2. Here we propose compressing the raw ACC data into summary statistics within the tracking device (before transmission) to reduce data size, as a means to overcome limitations in storage and energy capacity.
3. We explored this type of lossy data compression in the accelerometer data of tagged Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) collected in spring 2017. By using software settings in which bouts of 2 s of both raw ACC data and summary statistics were collected in parallel but with different bout intervals to keep total data size comparable, we created the opportunity for a direct comparison of time budgets derived by the two data collection methods. 
4. We found that the data compression in our case yielded a 6 time reduction in data size per bout, and concurrent, similar decreases in storage and energy use of the device. We show that with the same accuracy of the behavioural classification, the freed memory and energy of the device can be used to increase the monitoring effort, resulting in a more detailed representation of the individuals’ time budget. Rare and/or short behaviours such as daily roost flights, were picked up significantly more when collecting summary statistics instead of raw ACC data (but note differences in sampling rate). Such level of detail can be of essential importance, for instance to make a reliable estimate of the energy budgets of individuals.
5. In conclusion, we argue that this type of lossy data compression can be a well‐considered choice in study situations where limitations in energy and storage space of the device pose a problem. Ultimately these developments can allow for long‐term and nearly continuous remote‐monitoring of the behaviour of free‐ranging animals.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2017-02-01 00:00:14.000,2017-05-31 23:46:24.000,96373,"Cygnus columbianus","GPS,Acceleration,Accessory Measurements","RaschaN (Rascha Nuijten)"

Peregrine Falcons used at least three broad, general routes south from the breeding areas, and individuals stopped migrating as far north as the U.S.A. mid-Atlantic coast and as far south as central Argentina. The radiomarked Peregrine Falcons used coastal routes, mid-continental routes, and water-crossing routes: the Davis Strait and Caribbean Sea. During northward migration, Peregrines migrating through at Padre Island, Texas diverged for destinations from central Alaska across the continent to central West Greenland. Swainson's Hawks migrated an average of about 13,504 km southward and 11,952 km northward, and travelled 188 km/d southward and 150 km/d northward. Swainson's Hawks converged in eastern Mexico on the Gulf of Mexico coast. Southward, these hawks followed a narrow, well-defined path through Central America, across the Andes Mountains in Columbia, and east of the Andes to central Argentina where they all spent the austral summer. Swainson's Hawks northward migration largely retraced their southward route.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",1995-07-29 00:00:00.000,1998-06-24 00:56:00.000,4514,"Buteo swainsoni","Argos Doppler Shift","kochert (Michael N.

However, most of these energy sources are not thought to be available at night because of the lower thermal potential in the nocturnal atmosphere, as well as the difficulty of locating features that generate uplift. Despite this, several bat species have been observed hundreds to thousands of meters above the ground. Individuals make repeated, energetically costly high-altitude ascents, and others fly at some of the fastest speeds observed for powered vertebrate flight. We hypothesized that bats use orographic uplift to reach high altitudes, and that both this uplift and bat high-altitude ascents would be highly predictable. By superimposing detailed three-dimensional GPS tracking of European free-tailed bats (Tadarida teniotis) on high-resolution regional wind data, we show that bats do indeed use the energy of orographic uplift to climb to over 1,600 m, and also that they reach maximum sustained self-powered airspeeds of 135 km h−1. We show that wind and topography can predict areas of the landscape able to support high-altitude ascents, and that bats use these locations to reach high altitudes while reducing airspeeds. Bats then integrate wind conditions to guide high-altitude ascents, deftly exploiting vertical wind energy in the nocturnal landscape.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2017-08-08 20:15:30.000,2017-08-15 03:59:05.000,9873,"Tadarida teniotis","GPS","teague_o (Teague O'Mara)"

This was the first ever attempt to track African fruit bats using satellite telemetry. We tagged four bats with solar-charged 12 g satellite transmitters at Kasanka National Park in December 2005 and obtained a combined total of 104 different location fixes over a 149-day period. Before migrating, bats foraged as far as 59 km from the roost in a single evening; by contrast, one migrating individual moved 370 km in one night. Bats travelled an average 29 km day−1 over the period of study, with bats that appeared to be migrating moving north-west from Kasanka at an average 90 km day−1. The greatest cumulative distance travelled by a single bat was 2518 km in 149 days. The results show conclusively that the straw-coloured fruit bat E. helvum is capable of migrating thousands of kilometres across central Africa on an annual basis, implying that the fruit pulse in northern Zambia is richer than anything on offer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the same time of the year.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2005-12-01 15:42:20.000,2006-06-15 09:05:40.000,102,"Eidolon helvum","Argos Doppler Shift","gscumming (Graeme Cumming)"

On oceanic islands, flying-foxes are often the only seed dispersers or pollinators. However, many flying-fox populations are currently in decline, particularly those of insular species, and this has consequences for the ecological services they provide. Knowledge of the drivers and the scale of flying-fox movements are important in determining the ecological roles that flying-foxes play on islands. This information is also useful for understanding the potential long-term consequences for forest dynamics resulting from population declines or extinction, and so can aid in the development of evidence-based ecological management strategies. We examined the foraging movements, floral resource use, and social interactions to explain how intrinsic factors (body mass, skeletal size, and sex) affected the extent of foraging movements of the Critically Endangered Christmas Island flying-fox (Pteropus natalis). Our findings suggest that smaller P. natalis individuals are the primary vectors of long-distance dispersal of pollen and digested seeds in this species, providing a vital mechanism for maintaining the flow of plant genetic diversity across Christmas Island. Overall, our study highlights the need for more holistic research approaches that incorporate population demographics when assessing a species’ ecological services.

Pigeons were released from three locations prior to any experimental manipulation and released repeatedly from the same three sites as sham-lesioned control, right HF-lesioned and left HF-lesioned treatment groups. Analyses of homing performance and virtual vanishing bearings revealed no effect of either lesion treatment. A more in-depth analysis of path efficiency during the initial decision-making, en route and near home phases of a homing flight also revealed no effect of either lesion treatment. A last analysis on the learning and memory for positions along a previously flown route, a proxy for investigating the development of route fidelity, also revealed no effect of either unilateral lesion. However, independent of treatment group, some statistically significant effects were observed with respect to changes in performance across training and the different release sites. The current study revealed no detectable difference between the left and right HF-lesioned pigeons with respect to several navigational parameters of a homing flight.

Changes in reporting rates from bird atlas surveys suggest declines of up to 60 % over the last 20 years (1987-1982 vs. 2007-2013) across South Africa. Worryingly, large protected areas were not immune to these declines. For instance reporting rates in Kruger National Park (KNP; ca. 20,000 km2), an area often considered a stronghold for Martial Eagles, recorded a 54 % decline in reporting rates. It is not clear what the major drivers of declines have been in South Africa, nor what is contributing to the declines in these large protected areas. In this study we investigate the ecology of Martial Eagles in KNP to improve our understanding of the threats they face and how these threats at various stages in their life cycle may be driving declines within protected areas where one would expect that the species should be well conserved.

Scoter populations across the North American continent have undergone dramatic declines during the past 40 years. Scoters populations wintering in the Washington State portions of the Salish Sea have been documented to have been declining since 1978. In order to better understand some of the factors that may be causing these declines, the locations of the spring staging, summer nesting, and fall molting grounds were documented, as well as the migratory paths from, and back to, the wintering grounds.

In this context, we study the ecophysiology of little auks (Alle alle), which are the most abundant seabirds of the Arctic, and acknowledged ecological indicators of changing marine ecosystems in this polar region. Via a long-term study of little auks breeding in East Greenland (Liverpool Land), in place since 2005, but also through specific experimental and modelling approaches, as well as through a panarctic network of collaborations, we test the following hypotheses: (1) Arctic climate change is impacting the trophic status, the foraging ecology, the reproductive output, the body condition and the multi-annual survival of adult little auks during the breeding season. (2) Ongoing climate change impacts the migratory ecophysiology of little auks in the North Atlantic. (3) Flight and diving energetics condition the functional ecology of little auks, among the world’s smallest diving marine homeotherms. (4) Climate change is generating thermal stress for arctic seabirds, with impacts on their reproductive performances. (5) Environmental contamination impacts little auk ecophysiology, behaviour and breeding success, with long-term population effects. (6). The pan-arctic seabird community functions as a natural monitoring network for both legacy and emerging contaminants.

These studies highlighted the complexity of long-distance navigation in homing pigeons, which remains a poorly investigated aspect. In this tracking study we report how the homing performances of pigeons housed in Amino (Pisa, Italy) were affected by the presence/absence of a mountain range (the Northern Apennines) interposed between the home and the release site area (release sites: Trans = mountain barrier, Cis = no mountain barrier). We displaced unmanipulated control pigeons, anosmic pigeon, and pigeons transported in purified air to release sites located at a distance ranging between 95 and 246 km from home. There, birds were released without further manipulation. The navigational performances of anosmic pigeons were impaired at both Cis and Trans sites compared to both smelling groups. Both unmanipulated control pigeons and pigeons transported in purified air but allowed to smell environmental air at both the release site and after release displayed unimpaired navigational abilities at the Cis site, but impaired homing success and impaired homeward orientation at the Trans sites. Nevertheless, their homeward component was significantly greater than that of the anosmic birds at both geographical areas. This suggests that the Northern Apennine acts as a geographical barrier affecting the olfactory map accuracy of Amino pigeons, rather than totally reducing its spatial extent.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2014-09-07 09:27:00.000,2019-08-29 22:59:44.000,229857,"Columba livia","GPS","anna (Anna Gagliardo)"

We used three sources of information to evaluate the different hypotheses. First, we used genetic information obtained via feather samples from individuals of the three subspecies (S. a. aurocapilla, S. a. cinereus, S. a. furvior). In addition, quill mites (Acariformes, Syringophilidae) were removed from feathers and a fragment of their COI gene was sequenced to assess their species identity and population structure as possible reflections of host population structuring.  For two Ovenbird subspecies (S. a. aurocapilla and S. a. cinereus) we used light-level geolocators to quantify migratory paths and identify wintering areas. Paleo-hindcast projections from bioclimatic models of Ovenbird distribution were generated to identify potential locations of refugia for this species during the last glacial maximum as a factor explaining population genetic structure. We found relatively strong migratory connectivity within and among two subspecies, but little genetic support for the migratory flyway hypothesis.  Similarly, there was no difference in wing length and body weight between subspecies to support the morphology hypothesis.  Birds breeding in the Cypress Hills (S. a. cinereus) can be considered a distinct genetic unit, but there was no evidence of genetic differentiation or isolation by distance among all other subpopulations, providing most support for the panmictic population hypothesis suggesting that with the exception of those in Cypress Hills, Ovenbirds across Canada form one panmictic population.  There was also very limited genetic variation among the syringophilid mites, indicating that Ovenbird movements can maintain gene flow in symbiont populations.  These results are consistent with predictions from paleo-hindcast distribution models from two different global climate models indicating a continuous single refugium 21,000 years BP (ca. Last Glacial Maximum), with the possibility of a separate refugium for S. a. cinereus vs. other subspecies.  Our results suggest that two of the three Ovenbird subspecies are defined by criteria that can be considered arbitrary and may not provide a strong model for setting population management units.

We tested edge avoidance by forest understory passerines in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest and also compared their mobility and movement patterns in contiguous and fragmented landscapes to assess whether movements would increase in the fragmented landscape. Between 2003 and 2005, 96 Chiroxiphia caudata, 38 Pyriglena leucoptera and 27 Sclerurus scansor were radio-tracked. The most strictly forest species C. caudata and S. scansor avoided forest edges, while P. leucoptera showed affinities for the edge. Both sensitive species showed larger mean step length and maximal observed daily distance in the fragmented forest versus the unfragmented forest. P. leucoptera did not show any significant difference. There were no significant differences in proportional daily home range use for any of the three species. Our results suggested that fragmentation and the consequent increase in edge areas do influence movement behavior of sensitive forest understory birds that avoided the use of edges and increased the speed and distance they covered daily. For the most restricted forest species, it would be advisable to protect larger patches of forest instead of many small or medium fragments connected by narrow corridors. However, by comparing our data with that obtained earlier, we concluded that movement behavior of resident birds differs from that of dispersing birds and might not allow to infer functional connectivity or landscape-scale sensitivity to fragmentation; a fact that should be taken into consideration when suggesting conservation strategies.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2003-02-17 21:15:00.000,2005-04-15 13:33:00.000,4953,"Chiroxiphia caudata,Pyriglena leucoptera,Sclerurus scansor","Radio Transmitter","MiriamMelanie (Miriam Hansbauer)"

From six Water Pipits Anthus spinoletta having received a GPS-recorder in Uebersyren in 2015, 34 data sets dealing with the usage of an overnight sleeping place within this wintering area could be obtained. They showed that the pipits used a stretch of 8 km in length with a total surface of 0.66 km² inside of reeds. Besides two already known resting places inside the investigated territory, three yet unknown places were detected. The pipits equipped with a GPS-receiver regularly/often changed their roosting place; 32 of 34 sites were located inside the bird reserve „Vallée de la Syre de Moutfort à Roodt/Syre”.////

Abstract study 2: Origin and migration route of Water Pipit Anthus spinoletta wintering in Luxembourg detected by GPS. //
Information dealing with the migration route and the origin of Water Pipits Anthus spinoletta wintering in Luxembourg were obtained by GPS-loggers. From 50 pipits equipped with a PinPoint GPS store-on-board logger, only three data sets could be obtained, one of them covering only a short time. The results of 2015 insinuate that the pipits use different routes for migrating in a south-easterly direction to their breeding grounds and they possibly do not always take the shortest way. Two possible breeding regions seemed to be near Lazins in Italy and near mount Hoher Sarstein in Austria.

These changes may affect the distribution and migration patterns of marine species throughout the annual cycle. Species distribution models have provided detailed understanding of the responses of terrestrial species to climate changes, often based on observational data; biologging offers the opportunity to extend those models to migratory marine species that occur in marine environments where direct observation is difficult. We used species distribution modelling and tracking data to model past changes in the non-breeding distribution of thick-billed murres Uria lomvia from a colony in Hudson Bay, Canada, between 1982 and 2019. The predicted distribution of murres shifted during fall and winter. The largest shifts have occurred for fall migration, with range shits of 211 km west and 50 km north per decade, compared with a 29 km shift west per decade in winter. Regions of range expansions had larger declines in sea ice cover, smaller increases in sea surface temperature, and larger increases in air temperature than regions where the range was stable or declining. Murres migrate in and out of Hudson Bay as ice forms each fall and melts each spring. Habitat in Hudson Bay has become available later into the fall and earlier in the spring, such that habitat in Hudson Bay was available for 21 d longer in 2019 than in 1982. Clearly, marine climate is altering the distribution and annual cycle of migratory marine species that occur in areas with seasonal ice cover.

Tracking data is particularly powerful when combined with oceanographic information derived from satellite remote sensing, allowing insights into the functional mechanisms of marine ecosystems. While this framework has been used extensively over the last two decades, there are still vast ocean regions and many seabird species for which information is scarce, particularly in tropical oceans. 
Methods: In this study we tracked the movement at high GPS recording frequency of 15 White-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon lepturus) during chick-rearing from a colony in Fernando de Noronha (offshore of Northeast Brazil). Flight behaviours of travelling and searching for food were derived from GPS data and examined in relation to satellite-sensed oceanographic variables (sea surface temperature, turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration). 
Results: White-tailed Tropicbirds showed marked preference for clear and warm sea surface waters, which are indicative of low primary productivity but are likely the best habitat for preying upon flying fish. 
Discussion: These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that foraging habitat choices of tropical seabirds may not be driven by primary productivity, as has been widely shown for non-tropical species.

Geolocator data retrieved from two male phalaropes tagged in southern Chukotka, Far Eastern Russia, confirm that birds breeding in this region belong to the East Palearctic population and winter in the East Indies, suggesting that the division line with the West Nearctic population is farther to the East. The routes taken by the two phalaropes were almost entirely pelagic, totaling around 18,000–20,000 km round‐trip, with the birds continuously on the move during migration, rather than resident in any particular stopover site, contrary to most other migratory shorebirds.

The species is critically endangered in Peru, so a major aim of the study was to aid conservation planning by learning the wet season location of the country’s last known breeding population. We captured a breeding pair on October 27, 2010, and fitted the birds with Microwave Telemetry, Inc. GPS/Argos satellite PTTs. The pair migrated ~ 655 km from Manú National Park to the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia (Dept. of Bení) in a predominantly longitudinal migration, reaching their final destination on December 23, 2010. Major movements (>5 km per time period) were almost exclusively at night and were undertaken with and without moonlight. Foraging areas used at stopovers in the Llanos de Moxos were remarkably limited, suggesting the importance of grazing lawns maintained by the geese and other herbivores, possibly including cattle. Orinoco Geese are resident in the Llanos de Moxos year-round, so the Manú geese represent a partial migration from the Bení region. We hypothesize that cavity nest limitation explains the partial migration of Orinoco Geese from the Llanos de Moxos.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2010-10-27 14:00:00.000,2011-02-16 22:00:00.000,742,"Neochen jubata","GPS,Argos Doppler Shift","LisaD (Lisa Davenport)"

undeveloped open-dry habitats in response to snowfall or high summer temperatures.

Aim: To study local and long-range movements of Cinereous Vulture (Aegypius monachus), and investigate
the influence of environmental variables on spatial and temporal distributions of the species on a large
scale.

Methods: We use 4-year-long location data from 6 juvenile Cinereous Vultures fitted with satellite-received
transmitters to track their movements and obtain habitat suitability models.

Results: A few months after fledging, Cinereous Vultures may migrate from the Caucasus as far south as the
Arabian Peninsula. Their movements are concentrated in undeveloped open-dry habitats. High
temperatures push the vultures to higher latitudes and altitudes, while reverse seasonal movements are
triggered by the extent of snow cover.

Conclusions: Our study shows the importance of the Arabian Peninsula and Iran as wintering areas for
Cinereous Vultures. Long-distance movements by immature cinereous vultures are determined by climate
seasonality, and in light of climate-warming scenarios for the next 100 years, there might be a shift in
timing of the onset of the species seasonal movements and a change in the duration and geography of
its wintering and summering.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2003-12-28 00:00:00.000,2010-12-26 00:00:00.000,3555,"Aegypius monachus","Radio Transmitter","Lexo (Alexander Gavashelishvili)"

This study reports the near-real time monitoring of fine-scale behaviour of sunfish. The study was conducted in southern Portugal in May 2014 and involved satellite tags and underwater and surface robotic vehicles to measure both the movements and the contextual environment of the fish. A total of four individuals were tracked using custom-made GPS satellite tags providing geolocation estimates of fine-scale resolution. These accurate positions further informed sunfish areas of restricted search (ARS), which were directly correlated to steep thermal frontal zones. Simultaneously, and for two different occasions, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) video-recorded the path of the tracked fish and detected buoyant particles in the water column. Importantly, the densities of these particles were also directly correlated to steep thermal gradients. Thus, both sunfish foraging behaviour (ARS) and possibly prey densities, were found to be influenced
by analogous environmental conditions. In addition, the dynamic structure of the water transited by
the tracked individuals was described by a Lagrangian modelling approach. The model informed the
distribution of zooplankton in the region, both horizontally and in the water column, and the resultant
simulated densities positively correlated with sunfish ARS behaviour estimator (r s = 0.184, p=0.001).
The model also revealed that tracked fish opportunistically displace with respect to subsurface current
flow. Thus, we show how physical forcing and current structure provide a rationale for a predator’s
fine-scale behaviour observed over a two weeks in May 2014.","research",true,true,false,false,false,"na",2014-05-05 14:30:00.000,2014-05-18 14:32:00.000,1140,"Mola mola","GPS","llsousa (Lara Sousa)"

Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) are long-distance migratory shorebirds with a Holarctic breeding distribution and recent studies have documented population-specific migrations that vary in duration (short to long) and frequency of stops (none/few to multiple). Factors driving these population-specific differences are unclear. We studied the migration ecology of Whimbrels breeding in Alaska, USA, using satellite transmitters deployed from 2006 to 2010 and tracked through 2015. Whimbrels moved entirely within the Pacific Americas Flyway, and some conducted nonstop flights that exceeded 7 days across ~8700 km. Birds dispersed across numerous sites throughout the flyway, often using agriculture or aquaculture habitats.  Whimbrels generally exhibited fidelity to breeding and nonbreeding sites, but typically only exhibited fidelity to staging sites used prior to long, nonstop migratory flights. Alaska-breeding Whimbrels exhibited high variation in migratory behaviors which we attributed to the extensive breadth of nonbreeding distributions (~70° latitude across ~8600 km), a range that naturally shaped individual responses to unequal migratory demands.

Furthermore, migratory connectivity – the connections made by migrating individuals between networks of breeding and non-breeding sites – has important implications for population dynamics. The Whinchat Saxicola rubetra is declining across its range, and tracking data from a single African non-breeding site implies high migratory spread. Here, we use geolocators to describe the migration routes and non-breeding areas of 20 Whinchats from three British breeding populations. As expected, migratory spread was high, with birds from the three populations overlapping across a wide area of West Africa. On average, in non-breeding areas British Whinchats were located 652 km apart from one another, with some likely to share non-breeding areas with individuals from breeding populations as far east as Russia. Four males made a direct non-breeding season movement to a second, more westerly, non-breeding location in January. Autumn migration was through Iberia and around the western edge of the Sahara Desert, whereas spring migration was more direct, indicating an anti-clockwise loop migration. Weak migratory connectivity implies that Whinchat populations are somewhat buffered against local changes in non-breeding conditions. If non-breeding season processes have played a role in the species’ decline, then large-scale drivers are likely to be the cause, though processes operating on migration, or interactions between breeding and non-breeding processes, cannot be ruled out.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2016-06-19 00:04:00.000,2018-06-18 12:26:38.000,13056,"Saxicola rubetra","Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw","malcburgess (Malcolm Burgess)"

Large gulls (genus Larus) for example are mainly acting as generalist predators in the Arctic and hence interact with most other vertebrates. However, among the six large arctic gull taxa, including three long-distance migrants, to date none have been intensively studied.

To document the flyways and migratory behaviour of the Vega gull, a widespread but poorly known Siberian migrant, we monitored 28 individuals with GPS loggers over a mean period of 383 days.
Birds used similar routes in spring and autumn, preferring coastal to inland or offshore routes, and travelled 4000-5500km between their breeding (Siberia) and wintering grounds (mainly Republic of Korea and Japan). 

Spring migration mainly occurred in May and was twice as fast and more synchronized among individuals than autumn migration. Active mMigration bouts mainly occurred during day and twilight, but rates of travel were always higher during the few night flights. Flight altitudes were nearly always higher during active migration bouts than during other bouts, and lower during twilight. Altitudes >2000m were recorded during migrations, when birds made non-stop inland flights above mountain ranges and the vast boreal forest. Individuals showed high inter-annual consistency in their movements in winter and summer, indicating site-faithfulness to their breeding and wintering sites. Within-individual variation was similar in spring and autumn, but between individual variation was higher in autumn than in spring.

Compared with previous studies, our results suggest that the timing of spring migration in large arctic gulls is likely constrained by snow melt on breeding ground, while the duration of migration windows could be related to the proportion of inland versus coastal habitats found along their flyways (‘fly-and-forage’ strategy). Ongoing environmental changes could hence possibly impact the timing, but not the duration, of their migration in the future.

During two consecutive fall migration periods, we caught immature females on a stopover site in southeast Sweden, and translocated a group of them ca. 1,000 km to southern Germany. We followed the movements of the ducks via satellite GPS-tracking and observed their migration decisions during the fall and consecutive spring migration. The control animals released in Ottenby behaved as expected from banding recoveries: they continued migration during the winter and in spring returned to the population’s breeding grounds in the Baltics and Northwest Russia. Contrary to the control animals, the translocated mallards did not continue migration and stayed at Lake Constance. In spring, three types of movement tactics could be observed: 61.5% of the ducks (16 of 26) stayed around Lake Constance, 27% (7 of 26) migrated in a northerly direction towards Sweden and 11.5% of the individuals (3 of 26) headed east for ca. 1,000 km and then north.

This opens up the opportunity to study how migration develops within individuals in consecutive years and the extent to which the migratory program is constrained. Such knowledge is essential for understanding the degree of individual flexibility during the annual cycle, which may help identifying potential bottlenecks, where the range of individual decisions is restricted. In this study, we investigate repeatability in time of a long-distance migratory songbird, the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio, tracked across consecutive years (n = 7). Furthermore, we explore the population variability and dependencies between consecutive events of departure and arrival throughout the annual cycle in this species (n = 15). We find that individuals show high repeatability in timing of departure from their two main non-breeding areas in sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast, low repeatability is found in timing of arrivals to stationary sites throughout the annual cycle. Population variation in timing of departure and arrival was similar across all events, ranging from 30 to 41 days, and was highly dependent on timing of preceding events. We conclude that timing of departures is the key event potentially controlled by the individual innate migration program, while arrivals are more flexible, likely dependent on the environmental conditions experienced en route in red-backed shrikes. Still, apparent flexibility in the individual schedule may be hampered by overall constraints of the annual cycle.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2009-06-24 20:35:00.000,2016-02-29 17:21:00.000,12115,"Lanius collurio","Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw","lypedersen (Lykke Pedersen)"

Penguins’ foraging activity was repeatable despite varying annual sea-ice conditions. Birds’ site fidelity is constrained by both sea-ice conditions around the colony that limit movements and resources availability, and also behavioural repeatability of individuals driven by phenological constraints. Adélie penguins favoured sea-ice concentrations between 20-30%, as these facilitate access to open water while opening multiple patches for exploration in restricted areas in case of prey depletion. When the sea-ice concentration became greater than 30%, foraging site fidelity decreased and showed higher variability, while it increased again after 60%. Between two trips, the foraging site fidelity remained high when sea-ice concentration changed by ± 10% but showed greater variability when sea-ice concentrations differed on a larger range.

Trapping sites at inland lake sites were selected based on nest location records for
the entire state as provided by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and
Wildlife (MDIFW). These data were used to select and confirm active nest sites
based on their utility for the study and finalized through consultations with
MDIFW. At these inland lake sites, nests are generally associated with
super-dominant trees and negatively associated with distance to the lake shore,
areas of timber harvest, and overall anthropogenic disturbance. Initial efforts 
to deploy transmitters in the fall of 2013 and winter of 2014
resulted in two transmitters being deployed close to the Rollins wind energy facility
and one transmitter being deployed adjacent to the Bull Hill facility in Penobscot
County near the town of Lincoln. The primary eagle trapping efforts occurred in the
summer of 2015 when fifteen transmitters were deployed across the state. We
caught the eagles using floating fish snares at inland lakes and 
ponds, we collected small blood samples (≈ 2 cc) to conduct DNA sex tests. All
Bald Eagles were handled in accordance with the University of Massachusetts
Amherst Animal Care and Use Protocol 2012-0068 and USGS Bird Banding Lab
Permit 23140.

The telemetry units (< 3% of body weight, per BBL standards) collected data
on location (WGS84, ± 18 m), elevation above sea level (± 22 m), speed (± 1 kts),
and flight direction (± 1°) and was transmitted over the Global System for Mobile
Communications (GSM) network to data servers. The
transmitters were programmed to determine their geographic position and adjust
their duty cycle to record data every 15 minutes from one hour before sunrise to one
hour after sunset. We filtered out poor-quality GPS positional data (i.e., 2D fixes or

It is alleged that leopards fail to settle where they are translocated to, owing to territoriality. We address the need to publish more accounts of successful repatriation of leopards, but also include novel applications aimed at orphans and confiscated leopards. (2) We satellite collared 16 leopards which included a mixture of relocated, and translocated leopards, of which the latter included conventional Damage Causing Animals (DCAs, viz 'problem animals'), orphans and confiscations. We determined standard home- range metrics and assessed home-range stabilisation as a means of determining site fidelity. Premature mortality and site infidelity, i.e homing back to origins, were considered failures. We looked at range stabilisation by examining successive monthly ranges against that of the preceeding month, i.e UDOIs. (3) Relocations turned out to be residents (~3 km, n=3), while they were immune to intervention, while translocations resulted in 50% success (n=12), which were invariably confiscated adults of unknown origin, and simulations of natal dispersals of orphans (~25 km, n =3). DCAs never settled where released (~90 km, n = 5). Resident leopards showed high monthly UDOIs, and for those translocated, a minimum of 0.15 was benchmarked to suggest range stability, which also reflected large spatial ranging. (4) Success in HR establishment was associated with landscapes which were unsaturated by other leopards, but anthropogenic threats still persisted, such that survival after a year was ~45%, but was not different to the normal background mortality of areas outside protected areas in the country.

Monitoring signals indicated breeding grounds in the Taimyr and Yamal regions; important staging sites on the coasts of the southern Pechora Sea and the Kara Sea; and wintering areas that ranged from NW- Ireland to Guinea Bissau. The average distance traveled from wintering grounds to breeding grounds was 5534 km. Migration duration varied between 42 and 152 days; during this period birds spent about 95% of the time at staging sites. In spring most plovers crossed inland Eastern Europe, whereas in autumn most followed the coastline. Almost all of the birds departed during favorable wind conditions within just 4 days (27‒30 May) on northward migration from the Wadden Sea. In spring birds migrated significantly faster between the Wadden Sea and the Arctic than on return migration in autumn (12 vs. 37 days), with shorter stopovers during the northward passage.

Here, we describe the foraging movements of yelkouan shearwater Puffinus yelkouan, a seabird endemic to the Mediterranean Sea that spends its entire life cycle within this enclosed basin and whose future conservation is intimately linked to human-driven and climatic changes affecting the sea. The aim was to understand the main factors underlying the choice of foraging locations during the reproductive phases. A total of 34 foraging trips were obtained from 21 breeding adults tagged and tracked on Tavolara Archipelago (N Sardinia, Italy). This is the largest and most important breeding area for the species, accounting for more than 50% of the world population. The relationships between foraging movements during two different breeding stages and the seasonal changes of primary productivity at sea were modeled. Movements appeared to be addressed toward inshore (<20 km), highly productive, and relatively shallow (<200 m) foraging areas, often in front of river mouths and at great distances from the colony. During incubation, the Bonifacio Strait and other coastal areas close to North and West Sardinia were the most preferred locations (up to 247 km from the colony). During the chick-rearing phase, some individuals reached areas placed at greater distances from the colony (up to 579 km), aiming at food-rich hotspots placed as far north as the Gulf of Lion (France). The need for such long distance and long-lasting foraging trips is hypothesized to be related to unfavorable conditions on the less productive (and already depleted) Sardinian waters.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2011-04-03 05:06:00.000,2015-04-21 21:20:00.000,10649,"Puffinus yelkouan","GPS","anna (Anna Gagliardo)"

We tracked 35 individuals from two colonies using high frequency GPS-dataloggers over four consecutive breeding seasons. Contrary to expectations, kestrels relied heavily on thermal soaring when foraging, especially during periods of high solar radiation. This produced a circadian pattern in the kestrel flight strategy that led to a spatial segregation of foraging areas. Kestrels flapped towards foraging areas close to the colony when thermals were not available. However, as soon as thermals were formed, they soared on them towards foraging areas far from the colony, especially when they were surrounded by poor foraging habitats. This reduced the chick provisioning rate at the colony. Given that lesser kestrels have a preference for feeding on large insects, and considering the average distance they cover to capture them during foraging trips, to commute using flapping flight would result in a negative energy balance for the family group. Our results show that lesser kestrels prioritize saving energy when foraging, suggesting that kestrels are more energy than time-constrained during the breeding season.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2011-06-15 00:48:34.000,2016-06-20 09:30:34.000,876767,"Falco naumanni","GPS","jhpliego (Jesús Hernández-Pliego)"

Migratory divides exist for many birds, however for many taxa it is unclear where such boundaries lie, and to what extent these affect the connectivity of species breeding across their ranges. Sabine’s gulls (Xema sabini) have a patchy, circumpolar breeding distribution and overwinter in two ecologically similar areas in different ocean basins: the Humboldt Current off the coast of Peru in the Pacific, and the Benguela Current off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia in the Atlantic. We used geolocators to track Sabine’s gulls breeding at a colony in the Canadian High Arctic to determine their migratory pathways and wintering sites. Our study provides evidence that birds from this breeding site disperse to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans during the non-breeding season, which suggests that a migratory divide for this species exists in the Nearctic. Remarkably, members of one mated pair wintered in opposite oceans. Our results ultimately suggest that colonization of favorable breeding habitat may be one of the strongest drivers of range expansion in the High Arctic.

In homing pigeons, HF supports navigation by familiar landmarks and landscape features. However, what has remained relatively unexplored is the importance of HF for the retention of previously acquired spatial information. For example, to date, no systematic GPS-tracking studies on the retention of HF-dependent navigational memory in homing pigeons have been performed. Therefore, the current study was designed to compare the pre- and post-surgical navigational performance of sham-lesioned control and HF-lesioned pigeons tracked from three different sites located in different directions with respect to home. The pre- and post-surgical comparison of the pigeons’ flight paths near the release sites and before reaching the area surrounding the home loft (4 km radius from the loft) revealed that the control and HF-lesioned pigeons displayed similarly successful retention. By contrast, the HF-lesioned pigeons displayed dramatically and consistently impaired retention in navigating to their home loft during the terminal phase of the homing flight near home, i.e., where navigation is supported by memory for landmark and landscape features. The data demonstrate that HF lesions lead to a dramatic loss of pre-surgically acquired landmark and landscape navigational information while sparing those mechanisms associated with navigation from locations distant from home.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2019-06-11 07:51:31.000,2019-07-30 12:24:48.000,1269952,"Columba livia","GPS","anna (Anna Gagliardo)"

Over 20 years, there have been 55 transatlantic recoveries of Common Terns from the Azores population: six from Argentina and 49 from Brazil.The three tracked birds migrated south in different months (August, September, November), but the northern migration was more synchronous, with all leaving in April. The birds were tracked to three areas of the South American coast: the male spent November–April on the northern Brazilian coast (13N–2S), whereas the two females first spent some time off central-eastern Brazil (4–16S; one for 1 week, the other for 3 months) and then moved south to the coast of south-easternBrazil, Uruguay and northern Argentina (24–39S). Although caution is needed given the small sample size and errors associated with geolocation, the three tracked terns potentially travelled a total of ~23 200 km to and returning from their non-breeding areas, representing an average movement of ~500 km day–1. With the exception of Belém, in northern Brazil, and Lagoa do Peixe, in southern Brazil, the coastal areas used by the tracked birds were also those with concentrations of ringing recoveries, confirming their importance as non-breeding areas for birds from the Azores.

Bird migration is usually considered to be movements between breeding and wintering areas, while less attention has been paid to other long-distance movements such as moult migration.<br>
Methods: We use high-resolution satellite-tracking data from 58 taiga bean geese Anser fabalis fabalis from the years 2019–2020, to study their moult migration during breeding season. We show the moulting sites, estimate the migratory connectivity between the breeding and the moulting sites, and estimate the utilization distributions during moult. We reveal migration routes and compare the length and timing of migration between moult migrants and successful breeders.<br>
Results: All satellite-tracked non-breeding and unsuccessfully breeding taiga bean geese migrated annually to the island of Novaya Zemlya in the high Arctic for wing moult, meaning that a large part of the population gathers at the moulting sites outside the breeding range annually for approximately three months. Migratory connectivity between breeding and moulting sites was very low (rm =  − 0.001, 95% CI − 0.1562–0.2897), indicating that individuals from different breeding grounds mix with each other on the moulting sites. Moult migrants began fall migration later in autumn than successful breeders, and their overall annual migration distance was over twofold compared to the successful breeders.<br>
Conclusions: Regular moult migration makes the Arctic an equally relevant habitat for the taiga bean goose population as their boreal breeding and temperate wintering grounds, and links ecological communities in these biomes. Moult migration plays an important role in the movement patterns and spatio-temporal distribution of the population. Low migratory connectivity between breeding and moulting sites can potentially contribute to the gene flow within the population. Moult migration to the high Arctic exposes the population to the rapid impacts of global warming to Arctic ecosystems. Additionally, Novaya Zemlya holds radioactive contaminants from various sources, which might still pose a threat to moult migrants. Generally, these results show that moult migration may essentially contribute to the way we should consider bird migration and migratory flyways.<br><b>Note:</b> Nesting locations are not included in this dataset.","research",true,true,false,true,false,"na",2019-06-01 00:01:00.000,2020-11-20 17:55:00.000,840212,"Anser fabalis","GPS","antti (Antti Piironen)"

May 2013, the day and night habitat associations of radio-tagged Dunlin (Calidris alpina) were compared between
post-harvest flooded rice fields and managed freshwater wetlands in the Sacramento Valley. Dunlin had decreasing
associations with rice during both day and night from February to April. Dunlin exclusively used rice at night until
25 March, when they shifted to wetlands. During the day, Dunlin were regularly associated with both rice and wetlands
until 4 March, and they exclusively used wetlands beginning 25 March. Diel movements by individual Dunlin
revealed that birds using rice during the day also used rice during the subsequent night. Our findings suggest that
flooded rice, when available, may be more suitable as nocturnal habitat than managed wetlands, and the removal
of water from rice fields in February and March causes Dunlin to either use wetlands exclusively or leave the area.
Conservation of Dunlin, and likely other migratory shorebirds, may be enhanced by managing the agriculture-wetland
mosaic in the Sacramento Valley to ensure that an adequate amount of shallow-water habitats remain during
March and April, prior to spring migration.","research",true,true,false,true,false,"na",2013-02-08 00:00:00.000,2013-04-23 00:00:00.000,212,"Calidris alpina,Limnodromus scolopaceus","Radio Transmitter","auoptimo (Blake Barbaree)"

In 2011, grey-headed flying foxes formed a camp in Adelaide, South Australia, outside their previously recorded range. We used global positioning system telemetry to study the movements and foraging behaviour of this species in Adelaide in spring (September to November) 2015. High-frequency location data were used to determine the foraging range and the most frequently visited foraging sites used by each bat which were ground-truthed to identify forage plants. A total of 7239 valid locations were collected over 170 nights from four collars. Despite being a highly mobile species, the mean core foraging range estimate was only 7.30 km2 (range 3.3–11.2 km2). Maximum foraging distance from the camp in the Botanic Park was 9.5 km but most foraging occurred within a 4-km radius. The most common foraging sites occurred within the residential area of Adelaide and included introduced forage plant species, Lemon-scented gum (Corymbia citriodora) and Port Jackson fig (Ficus rubiginosa). Other observed movement activities included dipping behaviour on inland and marine waters and travel across flight paths around Adelaide airport. Our findings suggest that urban habitats in Adelaide provide sufficient foraging resources for grey-headed flying foxes to use these areas exclusively, at least in spring. This creates substantial opportunities for bats to interact with humans and their infrastructure.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2015-08-31 14:42:38.000,2015-11-02 02:00:33.000,145262,"Pteropus poliocephalus","GPS","droshier (David Roshier)"

Recent studies have shown that grazing ecosystems are much more complex and dynamic than was previously assumed and that pastoralists adaptively manage these systems. However, we still have little understanding how everyday herding affects ecosystems at the landscape level. We conducted a study of daily herd movements and grazing strategies in a mobile pastoral system in the Logone floodplain, Cameroon. We integrated GPS/GIS technology, video recordings of animal behavior, and ethnographic methods to develop a more accurate measurement of grazing pressure that takes into account both livestock densities and grazing behavior. We used the resulting grazing pressure data to evaluate existing conceptual models of grazing pressure at a landscape level. We found that models that predict that grazing pressure is skewed towards the direction of water most accurately reflect the situation in the Logone floodplain in the dry season. However, we found that the higher grazing pressure is not only the result of a higher density of cattle but also a change in the grazing behavior of animals after watering. Finally, we caution that the models of grazing pressure in the dry season cannot simply be extrapolated to the landscape level because mobile pastoralists do not remain in one central place.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2009-03-11 05:13:00.000,2009-03-26 05:04:00.000,166921,"Bos taurus","GPS","Mark Moritz (Mark Moritz)"

Passive soaring birds utilise warm rising‐air columns (thermals) to climb up and obtain potential energy for flying across large areas. However, the utilisation of such inconsistent natural resources may be challenging for soaring‐gliding birds and involve a set of decisions to maintain efficient flight. (2) To assess which temporal scales of previous experience with environmental inputs best predicted thermal‐climbing departure decisions of soaring birds, we used movement data from Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) tracked by GPS transmitters. We applied Cox proportional hazard regression and a model selection approach to identify thermal‐climbing departure decisions and to compare a range of temporal scales. (3) Our findings support the use of current and recent (short‐term; last 20 minutes) experiences, compared to longer term, past experiences, in predicting the time until departure from thermals. The models supported decision rules that integrated information originating from different temporal scales, implying a tendency to depart from a thermal later when the current climb rate was stronger than experienced recently and vice‐versa. Additionally, climb rates in thermals revealed significant autocorrelation over short time scales (shorter than 30 minutes). (4) The correspondence between thermals’ characteristics and the factors that best predicted thermal‐climbing departure decisions presumably reflect optimal decisions individuals make to handle their dynamic environment and to reduce movement‐related costs of such a basic activity for soaring‐gliding birds.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2012-10-15 13:40:12.000,2014-10-20 08:21:06.000,3392898,"Gyps fulvus","GPS","roiharel (Roi Harel)"

Flying organisms, such as bats, may thus benefit from modifying their flight in response to the wind vector. Yet, practical difficulties have so far limited the understanding of this response for free-ranging bats. We tracked nine straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) that flew 42.5+17.5km (mean + s.d.) to and from their roost near Accra, Ghana. Following detailed atmospheric simulations, we found that bats compensated for wind drift, as predicted under constant winds, and decreased their airspeed in response to tailwind assistance such that their groundspeed remained nearly constant. In addition, bats increased their airspeed with increasing crosswind speed. Overall, bats modulated their airspeed in relation to wind speed at different wind directions in a manner predicted by a two-dimensional optimal move- ment model. We conclude that sophisticated behavioural mechanisms to minimize the cost of transport under various wind conditions have evolved in bats. The bats’ response to the wind is similar to that reported for migratory birds and insects, suggesting convergent evolution of flight behaviours in volant organisms.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2011-02-02 18:22:30.000,2011-02-09 04:05:01.000,614,"Eidolon helvum","GPS","nir_sapir (Nir Sapir)"

The Lévy-flight foraging hypothesis (LFFH) suggests a single optimal food search strategy to explain this pattern, yet mixed movement distributions are biologically more plausible and often convincingly fit movement data. To confront alternative explanations for these patterns, we tracked vultures of three species in two very different ecosystems using high-resolution GPS/accelerometer tags accompanied by behavioral, genetic and morphological data. The Lévy distribution fitted the datasets reasonably well, matching expectations based on their sparsely distributed food resources; yet, the fit of mixed models was considerably better, suggesting distinct movement modes operating at three different scales. Specifically, long-range forays (LRFs)—rare, short-term, large-scale circular journeys that greatly exceed the typical foraging range and contribute to the tail-fatness of the movement distribution in all three species—do not match an optimal foraging strategy suggested by the LFFH. We also found no support for preferred weather conditions or population genetic structure as alternative explanations, so the hypothesis that LRFs represent failed breeding dispersal attempts to find mates remains our most plausible explanation at this time.

We translocated birds westward (1080 km) or eastward (885 km) to simulate natural navigational challenges. When translocated westwards and outside their migratory corridor birds with olfactory nerve section kept a clear directional preference (southerly) but were unable to compensate for the displacement, while intact birds and gulls with the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve sectioned oriented towards their population-specific migratory corridor.

Space use estimates can inform conservation management but relaying high-accuracy locations is often not straightforward. We used Fastloc-GPS Argos satellite tags with the innovation of additional data relay via a ground station (termed a “Mote”) to record high volumes (typically > 20 locations per individual per day) of high accuracy tracking data. Tags were attached in the Chagos Archipelago in 2018-2019 to 23 immature turtles of two species for which there have been long-standing conservation concerns: 21 hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) and two green turtles (Chelonia mydas). Over long tracking durations (mean 227.6 days per individual), most turtles moved very little. For example, 17 of 21 hawksbill turtles remained continuously in the lagoon where they were equipped, with 95% and 50% Utilisation Distributions (UDs) averaging only 1.03 and 0.18 km2 respectively. Many individuals, and both species, could use the same small spaces, i.e., individuals did not maintain unique home ranges. However, three hawksbill turtles travelled 100s of km from the tagging site. Our results show that for some large marine vertebrates, even small protected areas of only a few km2 can encompass the movements of a large proportion of individuals over long periods. High accuracy tracking may likewise reveal the details of space use for many other animals that move little and/or use important focal areas and where previous low-accuracy tracking techniques have tended to overestimate space use.","research",true,true,false,true,false,"na",2018-06-27 12:24:00.000,2019-12-08 17:08:16.000,88727,"Chelonia mydas,Eretmochelys imbricata","GPS","HaysLab (Alex Rattray)"

Here, we investigate flight behaviour in seven free-flying Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) and report that the maximum ground speeds achieved exceed speeds previously documented for any bat. Regional wind modelling indicates that bats adjusted flight speeds in response to winds by flying more slowly as wind support increased and flying faster when confronted with crosswinds, as demonstrated for insects, birds and other bats. Increased frequency of pauses in wing beats at faster speeds suggests that flap-gliding assists the bats’ rapid flight.

What information individuals use for movement coordination is, however, very difficult to know, except for echolocating bats. These flying mammals perceive their surroundings by emitting loud and high-pitched biosonar calls and listening for the returning echoes. Because bat biosonar imaging is much sparser in information than vision, we can accurately measure the biosonar calls of interacting bats with a group of microphones and then calculate what each of the individuals perceived. When observing pairs of Daubenton's bats foraging low over water for stranded insects, we found they have intriguing `traffic rules' - they chase each other, perform tandem turns and even slow down to avoid collision. When we then modelled their biosonar view of the surroundings during these interactions we discovered that one simple trick suffices to create all their interactive behaviours: once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo, copy this individual's flight direction within 4-5 of your own wingbeats.<br>NOTE: Sensor type is 2D videogrammetry, not GPS.

Although there has been an increasing emphasis on making animal movement data publicly available, there has also been a conspicuous dearth in the availability of such data on large carnivores. Globally, large predators are of conservation concern. However, due to their secretive behavior and low densities, obtaining movement data on apex predators is expensive and logistically challenging. Consequently, the relatively small sample sizes typical of large carnivore movement studies may limit insights into the ecology and behavior of these elusive predators. The aim of this initiative is to make available to the conservation-scientific community a dataset of 134,690 locations of jaguars (Panthera onca) collected from 117 individuals (54 males and 63 females) tracked by GPS technology. [The published dataset here represents a portion of this dataset.] Individual jaguars were monitored in five different range countries representing a large portion of the species’ distribution. This dataset may be used to answer a variety of ecological questions including but not limited to: improved models of connectivity from local to continental scales; the use of natural or human-modified landscapes by jaguars; movement behavior of jaguars in regions not represented in this dataset; intraspecific interactions; and predator-prey interactions. In making our dataset publicly available, we hope to motivate other research groups to do the same in the near future. Specifically, we aim to help inform a better understanding of jaguar movement ecology with applications towards effective decision making and maximizing long-term conservation efforts for this ecologically important species.

We quantified the repeatability of leadership-based flock structures within a flight and across multiple flights conducted with the same animals. We compared two contexts of flock composition: flocks of birds of the same age and flight experience; and, flocks of birds of different ages and flight experience. All flocks displayed consistent leadership-based structures over time, showing that individuals have stable roles in the navigational decisions of the flock. However, flocks of balanced age and flight experience exhibited reduced leadership stability, indicating that these factors promote flock structuring. Our study empirically demonstrates that leadership and followership are consistent behaviours in homing pigeon flocks, but such consistency is affected by the heterogeneity of individual flight experiences and/or age. Similar evidence from other species suggests leadership as an important mechanism for coordinated motion in small groups of animals with strong social bonds.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2012-06-14 11:46:40.000,2012-06-26 11:57:55.000,159741,"Columba livia","GPS","cdsantos"

We radio tracked water opossums and collected information about their habitats and behaviour from October 2004 to April 2010. We combined common home range estimators for animals living in linear habitats with the synoptic model of home range and habitat selection. For the 10 individuals monitored, the home ranges varied between 0.80 and 9.66 km of watercourses; none of them had exclusive home ranges. The home range size for males was, on average, three times larger than for females. The overlap data showed that, on average, one male could encompass the home ranges of up to five females simultaneously, but more than one male could have access to the same female. For habitat selection at the individual level, we could not find any strong influence of habitat features on water opossum preferences because individuals selected different sets of habitat variables. However, at the population level, we found a negative relationship between home range size and river size. The water opossum seems to prefer shallow and narrow watercourses to establish its home ranges. Here, we present valuable information to advance our knowledge of the water opossum and its ecology, which is urgent for conservation purposes.","research",true,true,false,true,false,"na",2005-07-02 15:00:00.000,2010-05-03 04:47:00.000,357,"Chironectes minimus","Radio Transmitter","melinatarituba (Melina Leite)"

Extreme weather events have the potential to alter both short- and long-term population dynamics as well as community- and ecosystem-level function. Such events are rare and stochastic, making it difficult to fully document how organisms respond to them and predict the repercussions of similar events in the future.<br>
2. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which short-term events can incur long-term consequences, we documented the behavioural responses and fitness consequences for a long-distance migratory bird, the continental black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa limosa, resulting from a spring snowstorm and three-week period of record low temperatures.<br>
3. The event caused measurable responses at three spatial scales—continental, regional, and local—including migratory delays (+19 d), reverse migrations (>90 km), elevated metabolic costs (+8.8% maintenance metabolic rate), and increased foraging rates (+37%).<br>
4. There were few long-term fitness consequences, however, and subsequent breeding seasons instead witnessed high levels of reproductive success and little evidence of carry-over effects.<br>
5. This suggests that populations with continued access to food, behavioural flexibility, and time to dissipate the costs of the event can likely withstand the consequences of an extreme weather event.

However, the difficulty of tracking small birds between breeding and wintering areas has hindered progress in this area. To learn more about Kirtland’s Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) movement patterns throughout the annual cycle, we deployed archival light-level geolocators across the breeding range in Michigan. We recovered devices from 27 males and analyzed light-level data within a Bayesian framework. We found that most males wintered in the central Bahamas and exhibited a loop migration pattern. In both fall and spring, departure date was the strongest predictor of arrival date, though in spring, stopover duration and migration distance were also important. Though stopover strategies varied, males spent the majority of their spring migration at stopover sites, several of which were located just before or after large ecological barriers. We argue that loop migration is likely a response to seasonal variation in prevailing winds. By documenting a tight link between spring departure and arrival dates, we provide a plausible mechanism for previously documented carry-over effects of winter rainfall on reproductive success in this species. The migratory periods remain the least understood periods for all birds, but by describing Kirtland’s Warbler migration routes and timing, and identifying locations of stopover sites, we have begun the process of better understanding the dynamics of their full annual cycle. Moreover, we have provided managers with valuable information on which to base future conservation and research priorities.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",,,,"Setophaga ","Solar Geolocator Raw","nathanwands (Nathan Cooper)"

Here we study the ecology of the little-known Yellow-throated Bunting Emberiza elegans based on a multi-year study on its breeding grounds in the Russian Far East. For the first time in this species, we quantified breeding habitat parameters, calculated sex-specific apparent survival, and determined individual non-breeding locations using light-level geolocation.
We found that the habitat around song posts of male Yellow-throated Buntings is characterized by tree and shrub layers on richly littered moist ground. Habitat use overlaps with co-occurring Tristram´s Buntings Emberiza tristrami and Black-faced Buntings E. spodocephala, but territories differ especially in tree cover and litter cover. 
Based on four years of colour-ringing data of 72 individuals, we calculated an apparent survival rate of 36 %, with higher survival estimates for male than for female Yellow-throated Buntings. We found no effect of carrying a geolocator on survival. 
We retrieved six geolocators from males. All birds migrated south-westward during autumn and spent the non-breeding season at locations in China 700-1700 km away from their breeding sites. At least two individuals spent the boreal winter outside of the known range in northern or central China. Birds left the breeding area between early October and early November and returned between mid-March and mid-April.
Our data on habitat use, survival rate and migratory connectivity will help to assess threats to the populations of this enigmatic species, which might include habitat loss due to forest fires on the breeding grounds, and unsustainable harvest for consumption during the non-breeding season.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2018-07-16 10:58:38.000,2020-05-28 18:46:57.000,2097,"Emberiza elegans","Solar Geolocator","wielandheim (Wieland Heim)"

We compared the timing of migratory movements of Arctic-breeding geese on different flyways (Greenland (N=7), Svalbard (N=21) and the Barents Sea (N=12)) to examine whether flyways differed in the predictability of spring conditions at stopovers, and whether this was reflected in the degree to which birds were following the green wave. The numerous stopover sites of all birds were combined into a set of 16 general stopover regions. The predictability of climatic conditions along the flyways differed between sites, mainly because of the presence or absence of ecological barriers. Goose arrival at stopovers was more closely tied to the local onset of spring when predictability was higher and when geese attempted breeding that year. All birds arrived at early stopovers after the onset of spring and arrived at the breeding grounds before the onset of spring, thus overtaking the green wave. This is in accordance with patterns expected for capital breeders: first they must come into condition; at intermediate stopovers arrival with the food quality peak is important to stay in condition; and at the breeding grounds early arrival is favoured so that hatching of young can coincide with the peak of food quality. However, the birds’ precision of migratory timing seems uninfluenced by ecological barriers, indicating partly fixed migration schedules.

Broad-scale habitat fragmentation is a visible result of human land-use throughout the world, often resulting in deleterious ecological outcomes. The ability of fauna to persist in fragmented landscapes is influenced by their capacity to move and access important resources such as food, water and shelter. When resources are depleted and spatially heterogeneous, identifying high quality habitat patches and understanding how individuals move through the landscape is critical for effective faunal conservation and management.

Phillip Island, located south of Australia, is a highly modified and fragmented landscape that contains patches of native vegetation amongst a matrix of agricultural farmland and urban developments. The island supports an abundant population of swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor), but little is known about how individuals move through this landscape. 
We developed and tested an inexpensive custom-made GPS wildlife tracker that sends data via the mobile phone network. High-resolution movement data gained from the trackers enabled us to highlights features that facilitate movement and others that represent barriers. Further we modelled how wallabies select resources within the landscape and move both within and between patches. Information about movement patterns and resource selection generated by the analysis will inform and improve the management of swamp wallabies in human-modified and fragmented landscapes and more generally enhance our understanding of the challenges faced by fauna in changing environments worldwide.

Both sexes increased their visitation rate with brood size, but nestlings in enlarged broods grew significantly less post-brood size manipulation than those in reduced broods. Foraging range area was highly variable among GPS-tagged females but was unaffected by brood size. As such, increased visitation rate in response to brood size may be more energetically costly for far-ranging females.

Considering the importance to document home range features of the this species for its conservation and the interest in documenting potential effects of radio or GPS tracking techniques in the framework of research conservation schemes dedicated to small plunge-diving birds, we implemented a pilot study aimed at providing first data allowing to: (i) assess home range features of the European Kingfisher for populations with feeding locations unevenly distributed; (ii) define conservation implications for habitats exploited by such populations; (iii) evaluate possibilities to develop GPS tracking schemes dedicated to home range studies for this species of conservation concern that may be possibly developed for other small plunge-diving birds.

Methods: In 2018 and 2019, we equipped 16 breeding European Kingfishers (Alcedo atthis) sampled within the marshes of the Gironde Estuary (France), with miniaturized and waterproof GPS archival tags deployed with leg-loop harness (total mass equipment = 1.4 g; average bird mass = 40.18 ± 1.12 g).

Results: We obtained an average record per tag retrieved (n = 13) of 35.31 ± 6.66 locations usable for analyses, without significant effects on bird body condition. For the sampled population, data analysis highlight rather small home ranges exploited by birds (average = 2.50 ± 0.55 ha) composed, on average by 2.78 ± 0.40 clusters of locations. Our results also highlight: (i) a rather important home range fragmentation index (average of the summed area pooling all clusters, divided by the area encompassing all clusters = 0.36 ± 0.08); (ii) the use by birds of different types of small wetlands (wet ditches or small ponds within alluvial forests), often exploited in addition to habitats encompassing nest locations.

Conclusion: Our study reveals interesting GPS tracking possibilities for small plunge-diving birds such as the European Kingfisher. For this species, today classified as vulnerable in Europe, our results underline the importance to develop conservation and ecological restoration policies of wetland networks, integrating small wetlands particularly sensitive to global change.","research",true,true,false,false,false,"na",2018-04-07 05:32:00.000,2019-04-27 10:28:00.000,509,"Alcedo atthis","GPS","Raphael Musseau (Raphael Musseau)"

To create the necessary lift to support the same weight and maintain soaring flight in thin air birds might modify lift coefficient by biophysical changes, such as wing posture and increasing the power expenditure. Alternatively, they can change their flight characteristics. We show that vultures use the latter and increase circle radius by 35% and airspeed by 21% over their flight altitude range. These simple behavioural adjustments enable vultures to move seamlessly during their annual migrations over the Himalaya without increasing energy output to flight in high elevations.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2014-08-01 00:00:23.000,2015-07-04 12:10:05.000,1686920,"Gyps himalayensis","GPS","sherub (Sherub Sherub)"

We compared the timing of migratory movements of Arctic-breeding geese on different flyways (Greenland (N=7), Svalbard (N=21) and the Barents Sea (N=12)) to examine whether flyways differed in the predictability of spring conditions at stopovers, and whether this was reflected in the degree to which birds were following the green wave. The numerous stopover sites of all birds were combined into a set of 16 general stopover regions. The predictability of climatic conditions along the flyways differed between sites, mainly because of the presence or absence of ecological barriers. Goose arrival at stopovers was more closely tied to the local onset of spring when predictability was higher and when geese attempted breeding that year. All birds arrived at early stopovers after the onset of spring and arrived at the breeding grounds before the onset of spring, thus overtaking the green wave. This is in accordance with patterns expected for capital breeders: first they must come into condition; at intermediate stopovers arrival with the food quality peak is important to stay in condition; and at the breeding grounds early arrival is favoured so that hatching of young can coincide with the peak of food quality. However, the birds’ precision of migratory timing seems uninfluenced by ecological barriers, indicating partly fixed migration schedules.

We used behavioral change point analysis to segment the tracks of 41 ibis equipped with GPS backpacks to identify differences in the initiation and duration of four behavioral seasons (non-breeding, pre-breeding, breeding, post-breeding) related to use of urban habitats. We found that intraspecific variation in urban habitat use had strong carryover effects on the timing and duration of behavioral seasons. In particular, ibis with higher urban habitat use in non-breeding seasons had longer non-breeding seasons and shorter breeding seasons that started earlier in the year compared to ibis that primarily use wetland habitats.

Various methods have been developed for classifying animal movement at both coarse (e.g., migratory vs. sedentary behavior) and fine (e.g., resting vs. foraging) scales. A popular approach for classifying movements at coarse resolutions involves fitting time series of net-squared displacement (NSD) to models representing different conceptualizations of coarse movement strategies (i.e., migration, nomadism, sedentarism, etc.). However, the performance of this method in classifying actual (as opposed to simulated) animal movements has been mixed. Here, we develop a more flexible method that uses the same NSD input, but relies on an underlying discrete latent state model. Using simulated data, we first assess how well patterns in the number of transitions between modes of movement and the duration of time spent in a mode classify movement strategies. We then apply our approach to elucidate variability in the movement strategies of eight giant tortoises (Chelonoidis sp.) using a multi-year (2009–2014) GPS dataset from three different Galapagos Islands. Results: With respect to patterns of time spent and the number of transitions between modes, our approach out- performed previous efforts to distinguish among migration, dispersal, and sedentary behavior. We documented marked inter-individual variation in giant tortoise movement strategies, with behaviors indicating migration, dispersal, nomadism and sedentarism, as well as hybrid behaviors such as “exploratory residence”. Conclusions: Distilling complex animal movement into discrete modes remains a fundamental challenge in movement ecology, a problem made more complex by the ever-longer duration, ever-finer resolution, and gap-ridden trajectories recorded by GPS devices. By clustering into modes, we derived information on the time spent within one mode and the number of transitions between modes which enabled finer differentiation of movement strategies over previous methods. Ultimately, the techniques developed here address limitations of previous approaches and provide greater insights with respect to characterization of movement strategies across scales by more fully utilizing long-term GPS telemetry datasets.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2009-04-29 16:00:50.000,2014-12-31 23:45:09.000,1169859,"Testudinidae ","GPS","The_giant (Guillaume Bastille-Rousseau)"

We investigated how the temporal scaling of allometric patterns in movement vary over the course of a year, specifically during periods of motivated (directional and fast movement) and unmotivated (stationary and tortuous movement) behaviour and used state-space modelling to estimate seven different movement metrics of Galapagos tortoises. Allometric scaling of movement was more apparent during motivated periods of movement. During this period, allometry was revealed at multiple temporal intervals (hourly, daily, and monthly), with values observed at daily and monthly intervals corresponding most closely to the expected 1⁄4 scaling coefficient, albeit with wide credible intervals. We further detected differences in the magnitude of scaling among taxa uncoupled from observed differences in the temporal structuring of their movement rates. Our results indicate that the definition of temporal scales is fundamental to the detection of allometry of movement, and should be given more attention in movement studies.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2009-05-01 11:00:47.999,2012-12-31 23:01:30.000,502845,"Testudinidae ","GPS","The_giant (Guillaume Bastille-Rousseau)"

Nonetheless, thorough statistical treatment of Argos datasets is often jeopardized by their coarse temporal resolution. State-space modelling can circumvent some of the inherent limitations of Argos datasets, such as the limited temporal resolution of locations and the lack of information pertaining to the behavioural state of the tracked individuals at each location. We coupled state-space modelling with environmental characterisation of modelled locations on a 3-year Argos dataset of 9 breeding snowy owls to assess whether searching behaviour for breeding sites was affected by snow cover and depth in an arctic predator that shows a lack of breeding site fidelity. The state-space modelling approach allowed the discrimination of two behavioural states (searching and moving) during pre-breeding movements. Tracked snowy owls constantly switched from moving to searching behaviour during pre-breeding movements from mid-March to early June. Searching events were more likely where snow cover and depth was low. This suggests that snowy owls adapt their searching effort to environmental conditions encountered along their path.

Using six years of presence-absence data (2007–2012) spanning years of record-breaking drought and flood conditions, we evaluated regional occupancy dynamics of American mink (Neovison vison) and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) in a highly altered agroecosystem in Illinois, USA. We used noninvasive sign surveys and a multiseason occupancy modeling approach to estimate annual occupancy rates for both species and related these rates to summer precipitation. We also tracked radiomarked individuals to assess mortality risk for both species when moving in terrestrial areas. Annual model-averaged estimates of occupancy for mink and muskrat were correlated positively to summer precipitation. Mink and muskrats were widespread during a year (2008) with above-average precipitation. However, estimates of site occupancy declined substantially for mink (0.56) and especially muskrats (0.09) during the severe drought of 2012. Mink are generalist predators that probably use terrestrial habitat during droughts. However, mink had substantially greater risk of mortality away from streams. In comparison, muskrats are more restricted to aquatic habitats and likely suffered high mortality during the drought. Our patterns are striking, but a more mechanistic understanding is needed of how semiaquatic species in human-modified ecosystems will respond ecologically in situ to extreme weather events predicted by climate-change models.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2009-11-06 15:15:00.000,2013-09-19 18:51:00.000,2035,"Neovison vison","Radio Transmitter","aahlers2 (Adam Ahlers)"

We GPS-tracked monoc- ularly occluded and control binocular homing pigeons during seven group training releases and a final solitary release from each of two sites. The pigeons were then given one last release from each site after a phase shift of the light-dark cycle under binocular conditions, to distinguish compass-based orientation from landmark-based pilotage. Overall, pigeons homing with the left eye/right hemisphere (RH) dis- played a greater fidelity to the familiar space previously experienced than pigeons homing with the right eye/left hemisphere (LH). Another difference between the two monocular groups is that LH pigeons were more likely than RH pigeons to fly with other pigeons during the group training releases. The data support the hypothesis that the left eye/right hemisphere plays a more substantial role as pigeons develop fidelity to certain routes to home from familiar release sites, an enhanced fidelity that may be supported by superior memory for familiar landmarks.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2013-07-29 16:55:07.000,2014-09-17 03:35:10.000,6229315,"Columba livia","GPS","epollonara"

Along the migration flyway connecting breeding sites in the North American Arctic and wintering grounds in Europe or Africa, Nearctic species are confronted with significant barriers such as the Atlantic Ocean and the Greenland icecap. Using geolocation devices, we identified wintering areas used by Ringed Plovers nesting in the Canadian High-Arctic and investigated migration strategies used by these Nearctic migrants along the transatlantic route. The main wintering area of the Ringed Plovers (n = 20) was located in Western Africa. We found contrasting seasonal migration patterns, with Ringed Plovers minimizing continuous flight distances over the ocean in spring by making a detour to stop in Iceland. In autumn, however, most individuals crossed the ocean in one direct flight from Southern Greenland to Western Europe, as far as Southern Spain. This likely resulted from prevailing anti-clockwise winds associated with the Icelandic low-pressure system. Moreover, the plovers we tracked largely circumvented the Greenland icecap in autumn, but in spring, some plovers apparently crossed the icecap above the 65°N. Our study highlighted the importance of Iceland as a stepping-stone during the spring migration and showed that small Nearctic migrants can perform non-stop transatlantic flights from Greenland to Southern Europe.

When predators are removed, re-colonization for some species occurs naturally, and inter-island phylogeographic relationships and current movement patterns can illuminate processes of colonization. We studied a case of re-colonization of common eiders (Somateria mollissima) following removal of introduced arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) in the Aleutian Archipelago, Alaska. We expected common eiders to resume nesting on islands cleared of foxes and to re-colonize from nearby islets, islands, and island groups. We thus expected common eiders to show limited genetic structure indicative of extensive mixing among island populations. Satellite telemetry was used to record current movement patterns of female common eiders from six islands across three island groups. We collected genetic data from these and other nesting common eiders at 14 microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial DNA control region to examine population genetic structure, historical fluctuations in population demography, and gene flow. Our results suggest recent interchange among islands. Analysis of microsatellite data supports satellite telemetry data of increased dispersal of common eiders to nearby areas and little between island groups. Although evidence from mtDNA is suggestive of female dispersal among island groups, gene flow is insufficient to account for recolonization and rapid population growth. Instead, near-by remnant populations of common eiders contributed substantially to population expansion, without which re-colonization would have likely occurred at a much lower rate. Genetic and morphometric data of common eiders within one island group two and three decades after re-colonization suggests reduced movement of eiders among islands and little movement between island groups after populations were re-established. We predict that re-colonization of an island group where all common eiders are extirpated could take decades.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2006-06-03 00:51:25.000,2011-03-23 17:35:34.000,16239,"Somateria mollissima","Argos Doppler Shift,Accessory Measurements","mrpetersen (Margaret Petersen)"

However, the role of odours in navigation is still subject to debate. While according to the olfactory navigation hypothesis homing pigeons possess a navigational map based on the distribution of environmental odours, the olfactory activation hypothesis proposes that odour perception is only needed to activate a navigational mechanism based on cues of another nature. Here we tested experimentally whether the perception of artificial odours is sufficient to allow pigeons to navigate, as expected from the olfactory activation hypothesis. We transported three groups of pigeons in air-tight containers to release sites 53 and 61 km from home in three different olfactory conditions. The Control (C) group received natural environmental air; both the Pure Air (PA) and the Artificial Odour (AO) groups received pure air filtered through an active charcoal filter. Only the Artificial Odour group received additional puffs of artificial odours until release. We then released pigeons while recording their tracks with 1Hz GPS data loggers. We also followed non-homing pigeons using an aerial data readout to a Cessna plane, allowing, for the first time, the tracking of non-homing homing pigeons. Within the first hour after release, the pigeons in both the Artificial Odour and the Pure Air group (receiving no environmental odours) showed impaired navigational performances at each release site. Our data provide evidence against an activation role of odours in navigation, and document that pigeons only navigate well when they perceive environmental odours.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2010-07-02 05:17:02.000,2010-07-21 23:26:47.000,1323779,"Columba livia","GPS","martin (Martin Wikelski)"

Here we demonstrate a trans-Andes route for Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger cinerascens) breeding on the Manu River (in the lowlands of Manu National Park, Perú), as well as divergent movement patterns both regionally and across the continent. Of eight skimmers tracked with satellite telemetry, three provided data on their outbound migrations, with two crossing the high Peruvian Andes to the Pacific. A third traveled over 1800 km to the southeast before transmissions ended in eastern Paraguay. One of the two trans-Andean migrants demonstrated a full round-trip migration back to its tagging location after traveling down the Pacific Coast from latitude 9° South to latitude 37° S, spending the austral summer in the Gulf of Arauco, Chile. This is the first documentation of a trans-Andes migration observed for any bird breeding in lowland Amazonia. To our knowledge, this research also documents the first example of a tropical-breeding waterbird migrating out of the tropics to spend the non-breeding season in the temperate summer, this being the reverse pattern with respect to seasonality for austral migrants in general.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2012-08-06 00:46:53.000,2015-06-28 22:41:24.000,1738,"Rynchops niger","Argos Doppler Shift","LisaD (Lisa Davenport)"

Thermal stress is a major concern for large mammals, especially for savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana), which have amongst the greatest challenge for heat dissipation in hot and arid environments. Therefore, elephants must make decisions about where and how fast to move to reduce thermal stress. We tracked 14 herds of elephant in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, for 2 years, using GPS collars with inbuilt temperature sensors to examine the influence of temperature on movement strategies, particularly when accessing water. We first confirmed that collar-mounted temperature loggers captured hourly variation in relative ambient temperatures across the landscape, and, thus, could be used to predict elephant movement strategies at fine spatio-temporal scales. We found that elephants moved slower in more densely wooded areas, but, unexpectedly, moved faster at higher temperatures, especially in the wet season compared to the dry season. Notably, this speed of movement was highest when elephants were approaching and leaving water sources. Visits to water showed a periodic shuttling pattern, with a peak return rate of 10–30 h, wherein elephants were closest to water during the hotter times of the day, and spent longer at water sources in the dry season compared to the wet season. When elephants left water, they showed low fidelity to the same water source, and traveled farther in the dry season than in the wet season. In KNP, where water is easily accessible, and the risk of poaching is low, we found that elephants use short, high-speed bursts of movement to get to water at hotter times of day. This strategy not only provides the benefit of predation risk avoidance, but also allows them to use water to thermoregulate. We demonstrate that ambient temperature is an important predictor of movement and water use across the landscape, with elephants responding facultatively to a “landscape of thermal stress.""","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2007-08-13 00:30:00.000,2009-08-12 21:30:00.000,283688,"Loxodonta africana","GPS","abivanak (Abi Tamim Vanak)"

Fruit secondary compounds can thwart beneficial dispersers in different ways, but the costs are difficult to quantify. Because seeds are difficult to follow from their parent plant to their final destination, little is known about where seeds are deposited by frugivores. Nevertheless, seeds benefit from travelling far from the parent plant as they escape from parental competition and elude specialized herbivores and pathogens that accumulate on adult plants. Thus high dispersal distance generally confers high fitness to seeds. We investigated a novel potential cost of fruit secondary compounds – reduced seed dispersal distance - by combining three datasets from previous work on a Neotropical bat-plant dispersal system (bats in the genus Carollia and plants in the genus Piper). We used data from captive behavioral experiments which show how amides in ripe fruits of Piper influence bat behavior. Previous work showed how these compounds decrease the retention time of seeds (gut retention time: GRT). With new analyses of this dataset, we further show that these defensive secondary compounds can delay the time of fruit removal. Next, with a behaviorally annotated bat telemetry dataset, we extracted post-feeding movements (i.e. seed dispersal distances). Using generalized additive mixed models we found that seed dispersal distances varied nonlinearly at short timescales (within the variation of observed GRTs) and longer timescales (over the course of the night). Last, we interrogated the models to infer that dispersal distances were reduced by: 1) previously reported amide-elicited decreases in GRT and 2) the delays in time of fruit removal by ripe fruit amides that we found in this analysis. By blending movement ecology and chemical ecology, we identified two mechanisms by which fruit secondary compounds can impose costs in terms of decreased seed dispersal distances: 1) small scale reductions in GRT and 2) causing fruits to forgo advantageous bat activity peaks that confer high seed dispersal distances.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",1994-04-14 00:10:00.000,1997-08-17 04:47:00.000,3343,"Carollia castanea,Carollia perspicillata","Radio Transmitter","JWBaldwin (Justin Baldwin)"

We observed that pigeons transported and kept at the release site in purified air and made anosmic at the release site were unable to orient towards home and were impaired at homing. By contrast, pigeons allowed to smell environmental odours during transportation and at the release site, although made anosmic prior to release, displayed unimpaired homeward orientation, but nevertheless showed impaired homing performance.

Given recent declines of long-distance migrant birds, multi-population tracking studies are crucial in order to assess the strength of migratory connectivity and to identify key sites en route. Here, we present the first large-scale analysis of migration patterns and migratory connectivity in the globally near-threatened European roller Coracias garrulus.<br>
Location: Breeding area: Europe; passage area: Mediterranean, sub-Saharan Africa, Arabian Peninsula; wintering area: southern Africa<br>
Methods: We synthesise new geolocator data with existing geolocator, satellite tag and ring recovery data from eight countries across Europe. We describe routes and stopover sites, analyse the spatial pattern of winter sites with respect to breeding origin, and quantify the strength of connectivity between breeding and winter sites.<br>
Results: We demonstrate the importance of the northern savannah zone as a stopover region and reveal the easterly spring loop (via Arabia) and leap-frog migration of rollers from eastern populations. Whilst there was some overlap between individuals from different populations over winter, their distribution was non-random, with positive correlations between breeding and autumn/winter longitude as well as between pairwise distance matrices of breeding and winter sites. Connectivity was stronger for eastern populations than western ones.<br>
Main conclusions: The moderate levels of connectivity detected here may increase the resilience of breeding populations to localised habitat loss on the winter quarters. We also highlight passage regions crucial for the successful conservation of Roller populations, including the Sahel/Sudan savannah for all populations, and the Horn of Africa/Arabian Peninsula for north-eastern rollers.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",,,,"Coracias garrulus","Solar Geolocator Raw","tom.finch (Tom Finch)"

The so-called “olfactory activation hypothesis” challenged the specific role of olfactory cues in navigation by suggesting that olfactory stimuli only activate a navigational system that is based on non-olfactory cues, predicting that even artificial odourants alone are sufficient to allow unimpaired navigation. In this experiment, we compared tracks of experimental birds exposed to different olfactory stimuli before being made anosmic at the release site prior to release. One group of pigeons was exposed to purified air enriched with artificial odourants, while a second group was exposed to environmental air. The birds stimulated with artificial nonsense odourants displayed several behavioural differences from both untreated controls and anosmic pigeons exposed to environmental air prior to release: nonsense odourants birds were unable to determine the home direction, they mostly flew within a space outside the homeward oriented quadrant, and they flew shorter distances on the day of release. Our data failed to support a mere activational role of olfactory stimuli in navigation, and are consistent with the olfactory navigation hypothesis.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2013-08-21 08:01:20.000,2013-09-06 08:54:00.000,47466,"Columba livia","GPS","anna (Anna Gagliardo)"

Bats used diverse flight strategies, but generally flew lower than 40 m, with scouting flights to 100 m and a maximum of 300 m. We found no influence of weather on height and high-altitude ascents were not preceded by an increase in foraging effort. Wingbeat frequency was independent from climbing or descending flight, and bats skipped wingbeats or glided in 10% of all observations. Wingbeat frequency was positively related to capture mass, and wingbeat frequency was positively related to time of night, indicating an effect of load increase over a foraging bout.

The movement of these Openbills did not correlate with H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in domestic poultry, but was correlated with rice crop rotation and populations of the apple snails which are their preferred food. Viral spread within the flocks of Openbills was not observed.

Results: A tracked wood warbler migrated south-south-east to sub-Saharan Africa in Sudan and then west-south-west to winter in Côte d’Ivoire. The timing and route fits well within the distribution of ring recoveries although the westward movement after the Sahara crossing is not revealed by the ring recoveries, but only few recoveries south of Sahara exist.
Conclusions: The surprising westward movement south of the Sahara supplements the overall pattern revealed by ring recoveries and aids our understanding of the connectivity and site dependence in this generally declining species.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2014-06-13 20:49:00.000,2015-01-10 18:24:00.000,404,"Phylloscopus sibillatrix","Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw","lypedersen (Lykke Pedersen)"

They directly limit herbivore populations, which in turn maintain grasslands and associated systems. Those ecosystems have degraded in recent decades and the concurrent decline in lion population is believed to play a role. I investigated factors affecting lion behaviour and ecology including the effect of seasonal variation in wild prey herd size. Current levels of herbivore prey are significantly lower than before the creation of countrywide veterinary cordon fences and total lean season biomass was estimated at 375.5 kg.km-2. I placed GPS position locating radio collars on 13 lions in 6 prides in a study area of approximately 9,911 square kilometres in the north of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR), in central Botswana. The collars acquired total of 241,858 usable GPS fixes and I visited each lion monthly. Lion spatial behaviour appears to have changed in response to the decline in herbivores, although there is only a small amount of historical data. Lion home ranges were large (mean home range = 2116.5 km2, range 798.3- 4243.7 km2) compared to two prides from a study in the 1970s in the same area which had home ranges of approximately 337 km2. Those prides increased their range to today’s sizes only in severe drought years, but rainfall during the study period was high. I interpret this as evidence that seasonal lower herbivore densities have increased lion ranges, and reduced the number of lions in the CKGR. I estimate the current population in the study area at 307 adult lions, or 3.1 lions per 100km2. During months of high herbivore group densities, lions travelled further on a daily basis (mean daily movement distance of 7,160 m at lowest density, to 8,616 m at the highest density), and males on average travelled significantly further each day than females (mean of 10,071.6m per day for male, SD = 7099.4, maximum 48,462m and a mean of 7,633.6m per day for females, SD= 5,069.3m, maximum 29,470m). Females moved similar distances daily even while supporting cubs under 3 months old. Lions significantly preferred hunting prey species above 90kg, but also hunted the smaller warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) and African porcupine (Hystrix africaeaustralis). This has implications for conflict mitigation and lion conservation. I investigate the economics and extent of the lion livestock conflict in Central Botswana and explore potential management options in light of this new data. Management options should be carefully selected with consideration for economics, politics and local conditions, and should target locations where conflict mitigation can have the greatest benefit for both lion conservation and economic improvement of stakeholders in order to have the best chance for success. not a change in reserve management. After carefully examining the ecology of the Central Kalahari lions and the management of the reserve and farms in the area, I conclude that mitigating lion-livestock conflict is best achieved through improving grazing practices and not a change in reserve management.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2008-12-15 05:00:00.000,2012-04-04 21:00:00.000,166243,"Panthera leo","GPS","kalaharilionesearch (Kevin MacFarlane)"

Even in social species, it is unclear how migratory skills are transmitted from one generation to another and what implications this may have. Here we show that in Caspian terns Hydroprogne caspia family groups, genetic and foster male parents carry the main responsibility for migrating with young. During migration, young birds stayed close to an adult at all times, with the bond dissipating on wintering grounds. Solo-migrating adults migrated faster than did adults accompanying young. Four young that lost contact with their parent at an early stage of migration all died. During their first solo migration, subadult terns remained faithful to routes they took with their parents as young. Our results provide evidence for cultural inheritance of migration knowledge in a long-distance bird migrant and show that sex-biased (allo)parental care en route shape migration through social learning.

We captured long billed dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus; hereafter dowitchers) to study their molt patterns and length of stay in the Klamath Basin during fall migration and their migratory connectivity and overwinter space use in California’s Central Valley. Most dowitchers were in active primary molt when captured (83%, n=116), and molt stage increased during August and September. Radio-tagged dowitchers had an average length of stay after capture of 31.9 days (n¼54). After departing the Klamath Basin, we located 57% of 81 radio-tagged dowitchers in the Central Valley from December to February; most of the 228 detections occurred in the Sacramento Valley (39%) or Grasslands Ecological Area in the San Joaquin Basin (47%). Space use by radio-tagged dowitchers differed among the Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Basin, and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta sub-regions, which demonstrated the influence of varying amounts and distributions of habitat. We recommend that managers in the Klamath Basin provide shallow-water wetlands to support migrant dowitchers for approximately 30 days beginning around 1 August, but ideally wetlands should be maintained until 30 September if freshwater supplies are available. We also recommend coordinated management of shallow water wetlands within and between the Klamath Basin and Central Valley to optimize the use of freshwater, a limited and unreliable resource.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2012-08-19 07:00:00.000,2014-03-18 07:00:00.000,475,"Limnodromus scolopaceus","Radio Transmitter","auoptimo (Blake Barbaree)"

United States and monitored with Argos-GPS telemetry to investigate their
spatial behavior. Wood Storks in the US are protected as a Threatened species by
the Federal Endangered Species Act, and are distributed in the Southeastern US,
east of Mississippi and as far north as North Carolina. Altogether, 133
individuals from 14 colonies were captured from 2004 to 2012, and monitored
until 2019. Only valid GPS locations were kept in this dataset (total =
1,135,643 locations; 8,539±9,852 locations per individual). All coordinates are
in lat/long WGS84 (EPSG:4326). Times are in UTC. Two GPS schedules were in
place: either every 2 hours, day round; or every 1 hour, during daylight
(11:00–02:00 UTC; i.e. 06:00–21:00 EST). Altitude is what was provided by the
satellite tag, and is likely not accurate in the flat lands of Southeastern US.

In addition, the Reference data provides this additional information, for each
individual wood stork:

* `animal_life_stage`: Age class at capture (mostly adults and juveniles). Note
  that juvenile wood storks turn into subadults after one year (starting on
  March 1st), and stay so for 3 years, before being considered as adults;
* `deploy_on_timestamp`/`deploy_off_timestamp`: Start and end dates of
  monitoring.
* `duty_cycle`: Duty cycle (either SREL or UFL);
* Information on the colony of capture:
  - `study_site`: Colony name (and state);
  - `deploy_on_longitude`/`deploy_on_latitude`: Longitude and latitude;
* `deployment_comments`: Capture type (mostly by hand or rocket net).","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2004-05-28 02:00:00.000,2019-09-06 14:00:00.000,1134712,"Mycteria americana","GPS","basille (Mathieu Basille)"

This population of snow geese have traditionally used very discrete estuary and agricultural habitats associated with Skagit and Port Susan Bays.

The breeding grounds of this population are on Wrangel Island, Russia. Because Wrangel Island snow geese represent the last major snow goose population breeding in Asia, and the primary Russian goose population that winters in North America, it is a high priority for the Pacific Flyway and the subject of long standing international cooperative management and conservation. Data collected since the early 1970s on Wrangel Island indicates that the population has grown in abundance, become younger, and changed its behavior relative to traditional habitat and resources. These population changes have become more apparent since the early 1990s and appear to be in response to warmer spring conditions, earlier snowmelt, and changes in the predator community on Wrangel Island. Some of these changes are also evident in the NPS wintering population where the total overwintering population size has increased.

The objectives of this project are to examine the current relationship of the NPS population to other Pacific flyway use areas. This will include documentation of migration routes, phenology, staging areas, and stopover locations throughout the flyway. Particular questions that we hope to answer include: <br>

- When do geese depart and return to NPS during spring and fall migration?
<br>
- Where are important flyway use areas during migration?
<br>
- When and how long do geese use areas along migration routes?
<br>
- Document inter and/or intra-year interchange among NPS and other wintering areas.
<br>
- Do some geese that use NPS move to other locations within the flyway during the same winter or among different years?
<br>
- If NPS geese are moving to other locations, what is the timing of emigration and potential return to NPS?
<br>
The transmitters are programmed to transmit for three years.

We used hidden Markov models (HMMs) to identify three movement behaviour states from track characteristics, which we classified as transit, resting and foraging. Immersion data collected from the GPS tags allowed us to differentiate between the two slow-moving states, and confidently identify foraging movement behaviour. Validation of movement behaviour states using time of day and immersion data suggested HMMs successfully identified daytime foraging locations, although nighttime socializing or resting may have been misclassified as foraging. Our results can inform marine conservation of this vulnerable species by differentiating foraging from other at-sea movement behaviours, and is a first step to identifying critical foraging habitat. The methods applied in this study to classify movement behaviours using data from small GPS devices can be used in future studies of this species and other similar small, diving seabirds.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2018-04-29 09:30:11.000,2018-05-14 09:50:39.000,953,"Synthliboramphus antiquus","GPS","LaurieWilson (Laurie Wilson)"

Summers","The number of breeding common sandpipers has declined in Britain due to poorer return rates from non‐breeding areas. To investigate little known aspects of their annual cycle, breeding common sandpipers were fitted with geolocators to track their migrations and determine their non‐breeding areas. Ten tagged birds left Scotland on 9 July (median dates and durations are given throughout the abstract). Short‐term staging was carried out by some birds in England and Ireland, then for longer by most birds in Iberia before continuing to West Africa, arriving on 28 July. Six birds spent most of the non‐breeding season (October–February) on the coast of Guinea‐Bissau, suggesting that this is a key area. Single birds occurred in Sierra Leone, Guinea, the Canary Islands and Western Sahara. The southward migration from Scotland took 17.5 days (range 1.5‐24 days), excluding the initial fuelling period. The first northward movement from Africa was on 12 April. Staging occurred in either Morocco, Iberia or France. Arrival in Scotland was on 2 May. The northward migration took 16 days (range 13.5‐20.5 days). The main migration strategy involved short‐ and medium‐range flights, using tail‐winds in most cases. Variation in strategy was associated with departure date; birds that left later staged for shorter durations. Coastal West Africa provides two major habitats for common sandpipers: mudflats associated with mangroves and rice fields. Although the area of mangrove has been depleted, the scale of loss has probably been insufficient to account for the decline in sandpiper numbers. Rice fields are expanding, providing feeding areas for water‐birds. Meteorological data during the migrations suggest that the weather during the southward migration is unlikely to contribute to a population decline but strong cross‐winds or head‐winds during the northward migration to the breeding grounds may do so.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",,,,"Actitis hypoleucos","Solar Geolocator Raw","Louise.de-Raad (Dr. Louise de Raad)"

We used this technology to follow the annual movements of Bicknell’s Thrush (Catharus bicknelli), a rare, range-restricted passerine that breeds in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada and winters in the Greater Antilles. We found that thrush departure from breeding sites was remarkably synchronized range-wide, with most individuals leaving during the first week of October. The mean duration of fall migration (29 ± 10 d) was significantly longer than spring migration (17 ± 4.3 d). A lengthy fall stopover (6 to 33 d) detected for at least half of the birds in the Bahamas contributed to this temporal delay. Eighteen of 19 thrushes with geolocators fitted on breeding grounds likely overwintered on Hispaniola. Three thrushes that carried geolocators through two consecutive annual cycles showed little variation in overwinter locations, with inter-annual locations ranging between 0.25 - 0.58 degrees latitude for each bird. Our finding that Bicknell’s Thrushes stop over on their southbound migration near their wintering grounds, likely in the Bahamas, represents the first information on migratory stopover of this species, and suggests an important avenue for future research and conservation.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2009-06-04 03:02:59.000,2011-07-10 10:09:36.000,12510,"Catharus bicknelli","Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Twilight","kpmcfarland (Kent McFarland)"

We now further show that 1) HF-lesioned pigeons are less likely to display fidelity to a particular flight path home when released from the same locations multiple times, 2) intact pigeons are more likely to exploit leading-line landscape features, e.g., a road or the border of a woodlot, in developing flight-path fidelity and 3) even when flying a straight path HF-lesioned homing pigeons are more likely to display relatively rapid, oscillatory heading changes as if casting about for sensory, presumably visual information. The flight behaviour differences between the intact and HF-lesioned pigeons persisted across the four releases from the three locations, although the differences became smaller with increasing experience. Taken together, the GPS-track data offer a detailed characterisation of the effects of HF lesion on landscape-based, homing pigeon navigation, offering new insight into the role of the hippocampal formation in supporting memory-related, e.g., fidelity to a familiar route home, and perhaps perceptual-related, e.g., oscillating headings, navigational processes.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2019-07-11 08:56:18.000,2019-08-29 11:49:16.000,1176650,"Columba livia","GPS","anna (Anna Gagliardo)"

However, distribution models focus on adults, neglecting that immatures can inhabit vastly different areas. Here, we show that conservation efforts in the Southern Ocean are insufficient for ensuring the protection of the highly mobile Emperor penguin. We find that juveniles spend ~90% of their time outside the boundaries of proposed and existing MPAs, and that their distribution extends far beyond (> 1500 km) the species’ habitat range used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Such an adaptation should allow animals to reduce the cost of having a larger home range in areas with relatively low food availability. We studied how space and refuge use varied with local food availability in the Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata), a refuge-inhabiting rodent. We tested whether agoutis living in areas of relatively low food availability had larger home ranges, and whether this response was accompanied by an increase in the number of refuges used. We monitored agoutis in areas with contrasting densities of their principal food source the black palm (Astrocaryum standleyanum). We used both automated and manual radio telemetry to measure space use during the day and refuge use at night. Agoutis living in areas of low food availability had larger home ranges. All individuals used multiple refuges and the number of refuges was not correlated with home range size. Consequently, agoutis that had larger home ranges were forced to roam farther from their nearest refuge to find food. Our results do not support the hypothesis that prey animals use more refuges as they forage across a larger area. Agoutis with large home ranges and low-quality habitat should therefore face an elevated predation risk because they have to spend more time traveling, more time foraging, and are farther away from refuges on average. We hypothesize that agoutis, regardless of their home range size, use multiple refuges to reduce predictability to predators or reduce parasite loads.

To study non-breeding ecology and migration of the Common Nighthawk (Chordeiles minor), we observed, captured, and GPS-tagged individuals at Reserva Natural Rincón de Santa Marí­a, an Important Bird Area on the Paraná River in Corrientes, Argentina, from 2017 to 2022 (237 captures, 95 individuals, 556 GPS fixes from 8 females). Common Nighthawks arrived at the reserve (late November to mid-January) partway through flight feather molt; primaries 8, 9, and 10 molted consecutively until early February, followed by body feathers. Three tagged females spent December/January to March at the reserve, May to August in Florida (USA), and October/November to December/January in the Cerrado (Brazil), and at least one traveled 1800 km while molting P8. Recapture rates across seasons were 44% for females and 25% for males. Small body size and breeding locations in Florida are consistent with the chapmani subspecies previously recorded from Argentina. Direct observations and GPS tracking (8 individuals) revealed that nighthawks roosted during the day in mature exotic pines; foraged over pines and native grasslands for 26–41 min within ~40 min after sunset, nearly always in silence; and rested for the remainder of the night in native grasslands, on roads, or on rocky platforms. Common Nighthawks should be included among the growing number of migratory species that exhibit long-distance movements between stationary sites during their long non-breeding period. Our results also suggest site fidelity to non-breeding areas, a continuous molt-migration strategy, and some nuanced migratory connectivity. Programs aiming to conserve long-distance migratory aerial insectivores should support long-term monitoring led from the Global South, especially in the Cerrado and southern South America.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2019-01-18 06:00:11.000,2020-10-22 15:00:11.000,110,"Chordeiles minor","GPS","kristinacockle (Kristina Cockle)"

The legislation establishing the NCA requires that management of the area be based, in part, on research conducted there. Prairie Falcons use the NCA for only part of the year. Little was known about movement patterns between breeding and non-breeding areas, and even less was known about the extent of interchange among nesting populations. To determine if Prairie Falcon population declines might be related to conditions/factors in areas used during the non-nesting season, additional information was needed on behavior, habitat use, and mortality of Prairie Falcons during the non-breeding season. Specific objectives of this study were to: (1) characterize annual long-range movement patterns of female Prairie Falcons that nest in the NCA, (2) identify areas used by Prairie Falcons during the non-nesting season, and (3) assess breeding dispersal patterns of female Prairie Falcons.

breeding dispersal. We radio marked 40 falcons from April–May on their nesting grounds
in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in southwest Idaho. All falcons
with functioning transmitters left the Snake River Canyon from late June through mid-July.
Most headed northeast across the Continental Divide to summering areas in Montana, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the Dakotas. Prairie Falcons stayed at their northern summer areas
for 1–4 months before heading to the southern Great Plains or to southwest Idaho. The
Great Plains was a key migration pathway. Important wintering areas included the Texas
Panhandle and southwest Idaho. Most falcons completed their seasonal migrations within 2
weeks. Use of widely separated nesting, summering, and wintering areas appears to be a
strategy to exploit seasonally abundant prey resources. Most falcons had three or fewer use
areas during the nonbreeding season, and falcons showed a high degree of fidelity to their
use areas during each season. At least 21 falcons returned to nest within 2.5 km of where
they nested in the previous year, but one falcon moved to a new nesting area 124 km south
of her previous breeding area. Prairie Falcon movements suggest large-scale connectivity of
grassland and shrubsteppe landscapes throughout western North America. Conservation of
Prairie Falcons must be an international effort that considers habitats used during both
nesting and non-nesting seasons.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",1999-04-17 01:29:54.000,2003-09-28 03:18:03.000,10306,"Falco mexicanus","Argos Doppler Shift","kochert (Michael N. Kochert)"

At the time, these movements were not well understood and calving grounds not clearly identified. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset details all long-term tag deployments that have occurred to date on breeding stock E1. As such, this data provides researchers, regulators and industry with clear and valuable insight into the spatial and temporal nature of humpback whale movement along the eastern coastline of Australia and into the Southern Ocean. As this population of humpback whales navigates an increasingly complex habitat undergoing various development pressures and anthropogenic disturbances, in addition to climate mediated changes in their marine environment, this dataset may also provide a valuable baseline.

Data deposited to Movebank are the raw Argos locations, reference data detailing tag deployments and tag details as well as the location estimates generated when applying a state-space model to the raw Argos locations in order to account for the spatial error associated with Argos locations.

Using high-frequency movement data, we identified thermal soaring in a seabird previously thought to use only flapping flight; red-tailed tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda). We tracked 55 individuals breeding on Round Island, Mauritius, and examined the environmental conditions that predicted thermal soaring in 76 trips (ranging from 0.8 to 43 h, mean= 5.9 h). Tropicbirds used thermal soaring for 13% of their flight time on average (range 0 - 34%). Our results suggest that the profitability and use of thermal soaring was influenced by the wind, with birds more likely to soar when flying with tail winds. This should enable birds to reduce the amount of flapping flight without experiencing a substantial increase in trip duration. Birds may be able to increase the amount of thermal soaring outside the breeding season when they are less constrained by time and the need to return to a central place. This could lead to notable seasonal differences in flight-related energy expenditure in a range of seabirds, given that thermal soaring is not restricted to seabirds with morphological adaptations for slow flight.

Fifteen adults were captured during incubation on nests in 2019 at Bon Portage Island (43.469°N, 65.753°W) and Whitehead Island (43.664°N, 65.867°W). Data uploaded to a colony base station using UHF radiowaves. Duty cycles were programmed to record at 15 min sampling intervals for periods coincident with the breeding season (late Apr to early Oct, see section 2.2). Data for this study archived in this repository are limited to positions within 150km of Nova Scotia and to positions within a time window overlapping the breeding period, from Apr-30 through Oct-06. Some devices ceased transmission within one month of deployment while others continued to function through three breeding seasons. 

Raw data processing was conducted using R 4.0.2 (R Core Team 2020). Raw positional datasets for each bird were quality-controlled  using the SDLfilter package. We removed temporal duplicates and positions associated with unrealistic movement rates using a maximum of 100 km/h for herring gulls. Quality-controlled datasets for each bird were interpolated to 15-min intervals using the interpolateTime function in the move package, without interpolating over data gaps in the time series > 1 h.

(1) GPS/GMS transmitters and simple observations;
(2) data about the physiological state of animals in relation to external and internal factors through regular blood draws;
(3) classical behaviour observations for additional information about the hierarchy and the spatial distribution of the individuals.

differ in their roles during breeding, which leads to differences in their energetic requirements. We
therefore examined sex differences in the foraging behaviour of southern rockhopper penguins during
the incubation period, using GPS and timeedepth data, stable isotope analysis and an automated
weighbridge system. While males carried out mostly long trips lasting several days, females often used
coastal foraging areas on day trips. Stable isotope data suggested differences in prey composition
between the sexes, with consistently higher trophic levels in males as expected for their larger size and
ability to catch larger prey items. We applied ecological niche models to compare the environmental
conditions in the utilized incubation season habitat between the sexes, using MaxEnt modelling. MaxEnt
models suggested that the niche spaces of males and females are largely overlapping, but males have
slightly larger niche width. The most important environmental parameter was sea surface temperature.
The different energetic requirements related to the birds’ incubation and chick-provisioning pattern
seem to be the driving force behind the observed spatial segregation. Males make use of highly
productive areas to prepare for subsequent fasting periods whereas females forage in coastal waters for
themselves as well as for the chicks during the subsequent guard stage.

PLoS One:
Logger technology has revolutionised our knowledge of the behaviour and physiology of free-living animals but handling
and logger attachments may have negative effects on the behaviour of the animals and their welfare. We studied southern
rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) females during the guard stage in three consecutive breeding seasons (2008/
0922010/11) to evaluate the effects of handling and logger attachment on foraging trip duration, dive behaviour and
physiological parameters. Smaller dive loggers (TDRs) were used in 2010/11 for comparison to larger GPS data loggers used
in all three seasons and we included two categories of control birds: handled controls and PIT control birds that were
previously marked with passive integrative transponders (PITs), but which had not been handled during this study.
Increased foraging trip duration was only observed in GPS birds during 2010/11, the breeding season in which we also
found GPS birds foraging further away from the colony and travelling longer distances. Compared to previous breeding
seasons, 2010/11 may have been a period with less favourable environmental conditions, which would enhance the impact
of logger attachments. A comparison between GPS and TDR birds showed a significant difference in dive depth frequencies
with birds carrying larger GPS data loggers diving shallower. Mean and maximum dive depths were similar between GPS
and TDR birds. We measured little impact of logger attachments on physiological parameters (corticosterone, protein,
triglyceride levels and leucocyte counts). Overall, handling and short-term logger attachments (1–3 days) showed limited
impact on the behaviour and physiology of the birds but care must be taken with the size of data loggers on diving
seabirds. Increased drag may alter their diving behaviour substantially, thus constraining them in their ability to catch prey.
Results obtained in this study indicate that data recorded may also not represent their normal dive behaviour.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2009-11-14 00:13:35.000,2010-01-27 22:10:36.000,48644,"Eudyptes chrysocome","GPS","masello (Masello)"

Soaring birds also take advantage of warm rising air, so-called thermals, that allow birds to ascend passively to higher altitudes with reduced energy costs. Although it is well known that soaring migrants generally benefit from supportive winds and thermals, the potential of uplifts and other weather factors enabling soaring behavior remains unsolved.
Methods: In this study, we GPS-tracked 19 Red Kites, Milvus milvus, from the Central European population that crossed the Adriatic Sea on their autumn migration. Migratory tracks were annotated with weather data (wind support, side wind, temperature difference between air and surface—proxy for thermal uplift, cloud cover, and precipitation) to assess their effect on Red Kites' decisions and soaring performance along their migration across the Adriatic Sea and land.
Results: Wind support affected the timing of crossing over the Adriatic Sea. We found that temperature differences and horizontal winds positively affected soaring sea movement by providing lift support in otherwise weak thermals. Furthermore, we found that the soaring patterns of tracked raptors were affected by the strength and direction of prevailing winds.
Conclusion: Thanks to modern GPS-GSM telemetry devices and available data from online databases, we explored the effect of different weather variables on the occurrence of soaring behavior and soaring patterns of migratory raptors. We revealed how wind affected the soaring pattern and that tracked birds could soar in weak thermals by utilizing horizontal winds, thus reducing energy costs of active flapping flight over vast water bodies.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2015-09-17 15:00:00.000,2021-11-15 06:00:00.000,136079,"Milvus milvus","GPS","skrabalh (Jan Skrabal)"

Recent technological advances have led to GPS-tracking devices light enough for birds as small as ~30 g, creating novel opportunities to remotely monitor fine-scale movements and space use for these smaller species. We tested whether miniaturized GPS tags can allow us to understand space use of migratory birds away from their capture sites and sought to understand both pre-breeding space use as well as territory and habitat use on the breeding grounds. We used GPS tags to characterize home ranges on the breeding grounds for a migratory songbird with limited available breeding information, the Golden-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla). Using GPS points from 23 individuals across 26 tags (three birds tagged twice), we found home ranges in Alaska and British Columbia were on average 44.1 ha (95% kernel density estimate). In addition, estimates of territory sizes based on field observations (mean 2.1 ha, 95% minimum convex polygon [MCP]) were three times smaller than 95% MCPs created using GPS tags (mean 6.5 ha). Home ranges included a variety of land cover classes, with shrubland particularly dominant (64–100% of home range cover for all but one bird). Three birds tracked twice returned to the same breeding area each year, supporting high breeding site fidelity for this species. We found reverse spring migration for five birds that flew up to 154 km past breeding destinations before returning.

The species, which occurs only in the new World, can be seen as far north as southern Canada and as far south as Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America. Turkey Vultures also occur on many large and small islands including Vancouver Island, Canada, Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea, and the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. Six races or subspecies of Turkey Vultures are recognized by biologists: including septentrionalis in eastern North America, meridionalis in western North America, aura in Mexico, parts of the Caribbean and Central America, ruficollis in southern Central and northern and central South America, jota in South America and falklandica in southern South America and the Falkland Islands. The scientific name for Turkey Vulture, Cathartes aura, translates as “breezy cleanser,” most likely a reflection of its soaring and scavenging life style. Scientists consider North American populations of Turkey Vultures to be partial migrants, in that northern populations of the species migrate, whereas southern populations, in general, do not. Eastern North American populations of the species typically migrate no farther south than Florida and Texas. Western populations travel at least as far as Colombia and Venezuela, and some experts believe that some western birds may travel as far south as Brazil and Argentina. Millions of migrating Turkey Vultures have been counted annually at migration watch sites in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama. As scientists we are interested in learning more about the movement ecology of this extremely successful raptor, which seems to have one of the most flexible of all avian migration systems. Earlier reports from northern South America suggest that northern migrants, which are larger and more massive than local residents, dominate the latter when they arrive on their wintering grounds in December each year. The extent to which such dominance affects the breeding schedules and numbers of southern birds remains unknown, as does the extent to which individual migrants visit an over-winter in the same location each year. In the spring of 2003 Hawk Mountain Sanctuary initiated a long-term study of migration behavior in Turkey Vultures in an effort to learn more about the extent, causes, and consequences of their annual journeys. To date scientists at the sanctuary and its collaborators have placed tiny radio tags monitored by satellite on 21 Turkey Vultures in an effort to follow their outbound migrations south each autumn and their return migrations north each spring. Five of the satellite-tracked birds also had a data logger surgically implanted in their body cavities. The loggers record both core body temperature and heart rate. Recovering these data loggers allows us to determine fluctuations in both body temperature and heart rate associated with day-night cycles and migration activity. The Sanctuary and its collaborators also have placed red, yellow, or light blue numbered wing tags on more than one hundred Turkey Vultures in Canada, Venezuela, and the United States.","research",true,true,false,false,false,"na",2009-03-06 15:57:00.000,2025-12-14 01:00:00.000,259090,"Cathartes aura","GPS,Accessory Measurements","dbarber (David Barber)"

Using miniaturized light-level geoloca- tors, we provide the first irrefutable evidence that the blackpoll warbler, a 12 g boreal forest songbird, completes an autumn transoceanic migration ranging from 2270 to 2770 km (mean + s.d.: 2540 + 257) and requiring up to 3 days (62 h + 10) of non-stop flight.

In the Southern Ocean, there is an extensive fishery for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba that is projected to increase further. Comparing distribution and prey selection of fishing operations versus predators is needed to predict fishery-related impacts on krill-dependent predators. In this context, it is important to consider not only predators breeding near the fishing grounds but also the ones breeding far away and that disperse during the non-breeding season where they may interact with fisheries. In this study, we first quantified the overlap between the distribution of the Antarctic krill fisheries and the distribution of a krill dependent seabird, the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, during both the breeding and non-breeding season. We tracked birds from the world biggest Antarctic petrel colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land), located >1000 km from the main fishing areas, during three consecutive seasons. The overall spatial overlap between krill fisheries and Antarctic petrels was limited but varied greatly among and within years, and was high in some periods during the non-breeding season. In a second step, we described the length frequency distribution of Antarctic krill consumed by Antarctic petrels, and compared this with results from fisheries, as well as from diet studies in other krill predators. Krill taken by Antarctic petrels did not differ in size from that taken by trawls or from krill taken by most Antarctic krill predators. Selectivity for specific Antarctic krill stages seems generally low in Antarctic predators. Overall, our results show that competition between Antarctic petrels and krill fisheries is currently likely negligible. However, if krill fisheries are to increase in the future, competition with the Antarctic petrel may occur, even with birds breeding thousands of kilometers away.

In many cases, birds do not migrate strait from breeding to non-breeding areas but fly via a detour. All western European populations of red-backed shrikes Lanius collurio are assumed to reach their southern African wintering grounds detouring via southeast Europe. Based on theoretical considerations under an optimality framework this detour is apparently optimal. Here, we use individual geolocator data on red-backed shrikes breeding in Spain to show that these birds do indeed detour via southeast Europe en route to southern Africa where they join other European populations of red-backed shrikes and return via a similar route in spring. Disregarding potential wind assistance, the routes taken for the tracked birds in autumn were not optimal compared to crossing the barrier directly. For spring migration the situation was quite different with the detour apparently being optimal. However, when considering potential wind assistance estimated total air distances during autumn migration were overall similar and the barrier crossing shorter along the observed routes. We conclude that considering the potential benefit of wind assistance makes the route via southeast Europe likely to be less risky in autumn. However, it cannot be ruled out that other factors, such as following a historical colonisation route could still be important.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2011-06-29 20:30:00.000,2014-07-04 04:25:00.000,4403,"Lanius collurio","Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw","lypedersen (Lykke Pedersen)"

As a consequence of the links between biomes mediated by migrants, changes in one biome could affect remote areas in unpredictable ways. Migratory routes and timing of most Neotropical austral migrants, which breed at south temperate latitudes of South America and overwinter closer to or within tropical latitudes of South America, have yet to be described in detail. As a result, our understanding about how these birds provide links between South American biomes is almost non-existent. White-crested Elaenia (Elaenia albiceps chilensis) is a long-distance austral migrant that breeds in the Patagonian Forest biome and overwinters in tropical South America. Because this small flycatcher plays a key role in the regeneration of this ecosystem, our objective was to describe the annual cycle of White-crested elaenias to evaluate the degree of migratory connectivity between breeding and wintering areas and therefore to determine if there are specific biomes of northern South America linked by elaenias to Patagonian forests. Fifteen individuals were successfully tracked throughout a complete migration cycle using miniature light-level geolocators. All individuals resided and moved through the same general regions. During fall (March-April-May), elaenias were located in the Caatinga and the Atlantic Forest biomes, from Rio de Janeiro to the region near Salvador da Bahia, Brazil. During winter (June-July-Aug), birds were located further inland, within the Cerrado biome. Birds used three different routes during fall migration. Our results indicate that some individuals use a direct route, flying between 500-600 km/day, crossing desert and grasslands, while others took a detour, flying 100-200 km/day through forested areas with refueling opportunities. All birds used the Yunga forest during spring migration, with ten out 15 individuals showing a clear counterclockwise loop trajectories throughout their annual cycle. None of the elaenias passed through Amazonia, traveled to western South America or crossed the Equator. Eleanias exhibited a high migratory connectivity between breeding area in Patagonian Forests and winter areas, Atlantic Forest and Cerrado. Our results suggest that Patagonian Forests could be strongly impacted by changes in those biomes or in the Yungas.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2013-12-21 11:08:00.000,2015-10-06 17:32:00.000,7361,"Elaenia albiceps","Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw","sbravo (Susana Patricia Bravo)"

In recent decades, conflict between geese and agriculture has increased. Management practices to limit this conflict include concentrating geese in protected areas, or population reduction. To justify such management, we need to understand their effects on goose-related damages, which requires an understanding of how damage is influenced by goose numbers and species interactions.
2.	We combined data from monthly goose counts and GPS-tracked geese to estimate grazing pressures by barnacle, white-fronted, and greylag geese on agricultural grasslands in Fryslân, the Netherlands. Using linear mixed models, we related this to damages assessed by professional inspectors. 
3.	Our results show a positive non-linear relationship between assessed damage and barnacle goose grazing pressure, where assessed damage increases with a decelerating rate as grazing pressure increases. For white-fronted geese, we find a negative relationship, while for greylag geese both positive and negative relationships occur. For each species, the relationship is influenced by the abundance of the other two.
4.	For barnacle geese, the relationship can be explained by selection of fields offering the best balance between food intake and energy expenditure, and by grass regrowth, with the highest grazing pressures occurring over a longer time period or when grass growth rates are highest. The results for the other two species are likely due to spatial and temporal differences in foraging preferences compared to barnacle geese, with the larger species avoiding areas with highest damages.
5.	Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that herbivore population reduction may not directly translate into decreases in agricultural damages and should be used with care. Management aimed at concentrating geese in refuges could help to alleviate farmer-goose conflicts, though further studies are required to determine actual damage reduction. We also find that not all goose species contribute equally to agricultural damage; care should be taken to ensure wildlife management targets the right species.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2016-01-01 00:00:00.000,2020-05-31 23:45:00.000,479828,"Branta leucopsis,Anser albifrons,Anser anser","GPS","Nbuitendijk (Nelleke Buitendijk)"

Competition for the best breeding sites is supposed to be the main driver, but timing of migration is often also influenced by environmental factors such as food availability and wind conditions. Using GPS tags, we tracked 65 greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons migrating between western Europe and the Russian Arctic during spring and autumn migration over six different years. Contrary to theory, our birds took considerably longer for spring migration (83 days) than autumn migration (42 days). This difference in duration was mainly determined by time spent at stopovers. Timing and space use during migration suggest that the birds were using different strategies in the two seasons: In spring they spread out in a wide front to acquire extra energy stores in many successive stopover sites (to fuel capital breeding), which is in accordance with previous results that white-fronted geese follow the green wave of spring growth. In autumn they filled up their stores close to the breeding grounds and waited for supportive wind conditions to quickly move to their wintering grounds. Selection for supportive winds was stronger in autumn, when general wind conditions were less favourable than in spring, leading to similar flight speeds in the two seasons. In combination with less stopover time in autumn this led to faster autumn than spring migration. White-fronted geese thus differ from theory that spring migration is faster than autumn migration. We expect our findings of different decision rules between the two migratory seasons to apply more generally, in particular in large birds in which capital breeding is common, and in birds that meet other environmental conditions along their migration route in autumn than in spring.

This is especially true if long-range travels occur within crucial stages of a species’ annual life-cycle. Crested penguins, for example, usually disperse over several hundreds of kilometres after completing the energetically demanding breeding season and in preparation for the costly annual moult. A basic understanding of crested penguins’ pre-moult dispersal is therefore paramount in order to be able to assess factors affecting individual survival. The Fiordland penguin, or Tawaki, the only crested penguin species breeding on the New Zealand mainland, is currently one of the least studied and rarest penguin species in the world. We successfully satellite tracked the pre-moult dispersal of 17 adult Tawaki from a single colony located in the species’ northern breeding distribution. Over the course of 8–10 weeks the penguins travelled up to 2,500 km away from their breeding colony, covering total swimming distances of up to 6,800 km. During outbound travels all penguins headed south-west within a well-defined corridor before branching out towards two general trip destinations. Birds leaving in late November travelled towards the Subtropical Front some 800 km south of Tasmania, whereas penguins that left in December headed further towards the subantarctic front. Using K-select analysis we examined the influence of oceanographic factors on the penguins’ dispersal. Water depth, surface current velocity and sea level anomalies had the greatest influence on penguin movements at the subantarctic Front, while sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration were key for birds travelling to the subtropical front. We discuss our findings in the light of anthropogenic activities (or lack thereof) in the regions visited by the penguins as well as the potential consequences of Tawaki pre-moult dispersal for the species’ breeding distribution on the New Zealand mainland.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2016-11-10 16:22:59.000,2017-02-12 02:56:30.000,3774,"Eudyptes pachyrhynchus","Argos Doppler Shift","tomm (Thomas Mattern)"

The species, which occurs only in the new World, can be seen as far north as southern Canada and as far south as Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America.  Turkey Vultures also occur on many large and small islands including Vancouver Island, Canada, Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea, and the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic.  Six races or subspecies of Turkey Vultures are recognized by biologists:  including septentrionalis in eastern North America, meridionalis in western North America, aura in Mexico, parts of the Caribbean and Central America, ruficollis in southern Central and northern and central South America, jota in South America and falklandica in southern South America and the Falkland Islands.  The scientific name for Turkey Vulture, Cathartes aura, translates as “breezy cleanser,” most likely a reflection of its soaring and scavenging life style. 

Scientists consider North American populations of Turkey Vultures to be partial migrants, in that northern populations of the species migrate, whereas southern populations, in general, do not.  Eastern North American populations of the species typically migrate no farther south than Florida and Texas.  Western populations travel at least as far as Colombia and Venezuela, and some experts believe that some western birds may travel as far south as Brazil and Argentina.  Millions of migrating Turkey Vultures have been counted annually at migration watch sites in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama.

As scientists we are interested in learning more about the movement ecology of this extremely successful raptor, which seems to have one of the most flexible of all avian migration systems.  Earlier reports from northern South America suggest that northern migrants, which are larger and more massive than local residents, dominate the latter when they arrive on their wintering grounds in December each year.  The extent to which such dominance affects the breeding schedules and numbers of southern birds remains unknown, as does the extent to which individual migrants visit an over-winter in the same location each year.

In the spring of 2003 Hawk Mountain Sanctuary initiated a long-term study of migration behavior in Turkey Vultures in an effort to learn more about the extent, causes, and consequences of their annual journeys.  To date scientists at the sanctuary and its collaborators have placed tiny radio tags monitored by satellite on 21 Turkey Vultures in an effort to follow their outbound migrations south each autumn and their return migrations north each spring.  Five of the satellite-tracked birds also had a data logger surgically implanted in their body cavities.  The loggers record both core body temperature and heart rate.  Recovering these data loggers allows us to determine fluctuations in both body temperature and heart rate associated with day-night cycles and migration activity.  The Sanctuary and its collaborators also have placed red, yellow, or light blue numbered wing tags on more than one hundred Turkey Vultures in Canada, Venezuela, and the United States.

Management of Taverner’s cackling geese (""Taverner’s"") and lesser Canada Geese (""Lessers"") is confounded by difficulties delineating these subspecies on the breeding grounds due to similar morphological characteristics and undefined breeding ranges. The Pacific Flyway has been unable to finalize a management plan for Lessers and Taverner’s due to the inability to define and monitor these populations. Of particular concern, past marking projects of Lessers staging in interior Alaska and wintering in eastern Washington and Oregon found annual survival rates among the lowest and recovery rates among the highest for comparable populations of marked geese (Eichholz and Sedinger 2007). Delineation of the nesting grounds of these two goose populations, coupled with ongoing genetics research, is critical to the responsible management of Arctic-nesting small Canada geese. 

Project Objectives
1.Utilize satellite platform terminal transmitters (PTTs) to augment efforts to delineate the range of Taverner’s and Lessers.
2.Provide DNA samples to delineate breeding grounds based on genetic differentiation.  
3.Contribute to harvest information knowledge of Taverner’s and Lessers in the Columbia Basin by conducting annual fall and spring banding efforts.  
4.Collect morphological data on captured geese which, in association with genetics information, will enhance morphometric discrimination of Taverner’s and Lessers in the field. 

Key Findings 
•Since spring 2010, we have implanted 21 PTTs in adult female small Canada geese, including 12 spring and 9 fall deployments. We tracked the study subjects to their breeding grounds in northwestern Alaska for the summer (see breeding area map). The birds used breeding and molting sites near Kotzebue Sound, Bering Land Bridge, and the Lisburne Peninsula. They returned to eastern Washington in late October and early November. Most of the geese migrated down the British Columbia coastline, with the exception of one bird which migrated inland through central B.C. Contrary to expectations, none of the study subjects transmitted from known small Canada goose staging areas near Fairbanks, AK. As of September 2013, none of transmitters are active.  The last location was received in July 2013.
•Preliminary DNA analysis from the USGS Alaska Science Center indicates 5 of the 7 study subjects were “small-bodied haplotypes”, or Taverner’s. The other 2 “large-bodied haplotypes” were Lessers. 
•To date, we have received 92 reports of harvested geese from our banded sample. Five banded geese were recovered during the Alaska spring subsistence harvest, including one carrying a PTT.

Large, avian migrants that fly in V-formations were proposed do so for energy saving by the use of up-wash by following individuals and regularly change leadership. As groups have been rather homogeneous in previous work, we aimed to explore leadership and its flight mechanics consequences in an extremely heterogeneous case of social migration, namely in spring migration of goose families. In families the experience of group members differs strongly and inclusive fitness may be important. We successfully collected overlapping spring migration tracking data of a complete family of greater white-fronted geese (Anser a. albifrons) and extracted leadership, flapping frequency and wind conditions in flight. Our data revealed V-formations where one parent was flying in front at all times. Although the father led the family group most of the time, he did not flap at higher frequency while doing so. In contrast, the mother flapped faster when leading, possibly because she experienced less supportive wind conditions than when the father led. We argue that in heterogeneous, social groups leadership might be fixed and not costly if supportive environmental conditions like wind can be used.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2015-03-20 00:00:06.000,2015-06-30 23:31:08.000,955487,"Anser albifrons","GPS","andreakoelzsch (Andrea Kölzsch)"

Activity over the season (September–April) was remarkably constant. Compared to the average activity per half-day, excess activity alternated every 12 h, suggesting an increased need for rest during daylight after a night with excess activity, and vice versa. Between days, activity was allocated to half-days in a very flexible manner: Either day or night activity was increased for a number of days, before increased activity gradually switched to the other half-day.

But the Mesoamerican subspecies A. m. cyanoptera is highly threatened by poaching and habitat loss, largely driven by intentional forest fires, cattle ranching, and the expansion of human settlements. 

For more than two decades, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has been leading efforts to save MBR’s scarlet macaw population from extirpation through nest protection programs, monitoring macaw fledging rates at key nesting sites, raising awareness through environmental education involving local communities, and habitat protection initiatives including over flights. As a result, our scarlet macaw conservation strategy is based on a comprehensive and thorough analysis of the entire range of threats and interventions required to conserve the species in Guatemala. 

Currently, we are working to accelerate the pace of recovery of the wild scarlet macaw population through a combination of complementary interventions, including management activities designed to maximize the potential contribution of the natural production of wild scarlet macaws. These include pulling of low weight chicks from their nests to be raised at a field laboratory, placement of laboratory-raised chicks back within foster wild nests when viable, or release of laboratory-raised macaws back into the wild following their preparation within an in – situ flight cage. In addition, we are increasing the availability of nesting cavities by enlarging natural cavities to create potential nests, and preventing and combating Africanized bees’ infestation of nesting cavities. These bees are fervent competitors for nesting cavities and can kill young macaw chicks. Additionally, we have engaged local communities and partners in macaw conservation activities, such as AFISAP community forest concession that harbors important macaws nesting habitat.

Learning and recalling familiar landscape cues, which compose the visual, familiar landmark-based map, are necessarily processed by visual processing regions of the forebrain, such as the visual Wulst. Recent GPS tracking studies revealed persistent oscillatory flight behaviour at a scale of high-spatial resolution in Wulst- and hippocampal-lesioned pigeons, compared to intact pigeons in which this movement pattern seems to disappear after repeated releases. However, the factors that lead to this characteristic flight pattern are still poorly understood. By analysing the flight patterns of intact and Wulst-lesioned pigeons released offshore we found that landscape complexity is an important factor determining the display of oscillatory flight behaviour in both control and Wulst-lesioned pigeons; birds flying over the sea display little osciallatory flight behaviour, but once flying over land, oscillatory flight behaviour becomes evident. The analysis of the tracks of pigeons repeatedly released over both unfamiliar and familiar areas revealed that in intact birds the extent of oscillatory flight behaviour was reduced with increasing familiarity with the landscape. By contrast, Wulst-lesioned pigeons displayed persistent oscillatory flight behaviour regardless of the level of familiarity with the landscape. These findings suggest that the oscillatory flight behaviour contributes to the learning and integration of visual landscape information during the acquisition of a familiar landmark-based map. We discuss the possible role of the visual Wulst in familiar landmark-based navigation, proposing a spatial-cognitive brain network model in which both the visual Wulst and hippocampal formation play prominent roles.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2023-06-19 06:17:02.000,2023-07-11 04:04:33.000,2804743,"Columba livia","GPS","Sara Cioccarelli (Sara Cioccarelli)"

Tøttrup","The regular fluctuation of resources across the Globe guides movements of migratory animals. To ensure sufficient reproductive output and maintain viable population sizes, migratory animals should match arrival at breeding areas with local peaks in resource availability. It is generally assumed that breeding phenology dictates the timing of the annual cycle, but this is poorly studied. Here, we use light‐level geolocator tracking data to compare the annual spatiotemporal migration patterns of a long‐distance migratory songbird, the red‐backed shrike, Lanius collurio, breeding at widely different latitudes within Europe. We find that populations use remarkably similar migration routes and are highly synchronized in time. Additional tracks from populations breeding at the edges of the European range support these similar migration patterns. When comparing timing of breeding and vegetation phenology, as a measure of resource availability across populations, we find that arrival and timing of breeding corresponds to the peak in vegetation greenness at northern latitudes. At lower latitudes birds arrive simultaneously with the more northerly breeding populations, but after the local greenness peak, suggesting that breeding area phenology does not determine the migratory schedule. Rather, timing of migration in red‐backed shrikes may be constrained by events in other parts of the annual cycle.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2009-06-24 20:35:00.000,2017-07-07 17:55:00.000,29097,"Lanius collurio","Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw,Solar Geolocator Twilight","lypedersen (Lykke Pedersen)"

Distinct stopover and routing behaviour of diurnally and nocturnally migrating songbirds has been stated in the 1960ies but empirical confirmation is yet lacking widely. We studied the behaviour of individual diurnally migrating dunnocks and nocturnally migrating blackcaps by means of large-scale automated radio-telemetry. Birds were radio-tagged during their stopover at the German North Sea coast. Our data indicate longer initial stopover duration in the diurnally migrating dunnocks, opposing the hypothesis of nocturnal migrants needing more time to recover due to their longer migratory flights. Nonetheless, dunnocks stopped over more often along their tracks as when compared to the nocturnally migrating blackcaps. Behaviour en route did not differ as clearly between species challenging the general view of contrasting routings of diurnal and nocturnal migrants with regard to landscape and open water. Our results imply additional factors of relevance other than differences in species or daily migration timing per se. We discuss and highlight the need of detailed and individual based data to better understand stopover and routing behaviour of songbirds in the environmental context.","research",true,true,false,true,false,"na",2017-09-26 20:00:00.000,2018-11-18 07:55:23.000,134437,"Prunella modularis,Sylvia atricapilla","Bird Ring,Radio Transmitter","Birdmove (Bianca Michalik)"

A total of 33 manta rays were tagged with SPLASH10F-321A satellite tags across the four regions: Berau (n=5), Nusa Penida (n=8), Komodo (n=6), and Raja Ampat (n=14), yielding usable data from 25 tags. The rays were tracked for 7 to 118 days (mean ± SD = 50 ± 30) from July 2014 to June 2022. Results showed localized movements, strong residency near tagging sites, and high site fidelity as evidenced by area-restricted search (ARS) behaviors and frequent revisitations. Most manta rays showed restricted home ranges in each region, with no connectivity between regions. Across 25 individuals, the home range (95% utilization distributions) varied significantly, ranging from 19 to 48,294 km² (mean ± SD = 4,667 ± 10,354).

Little is known about the natural history and ecology of the striped mud turtle (Kinosternon baurii), although previous work in Florida suggest that these aquatic turtles are highly terrestrial and nest primarily in the fall. We are currently conducting a population and spatial ecology project on the striped mud turtle using radio telemetry at Circle B Bar Reserve, a restored former cattle ranch adjacent to Lake Hancock, Polk County, Florida. To date, we are tracking six striped mud turtles, and we are collecting standard natural history data on morphology and reproduction. In addition, we have implemented a continuous mark and recapture study for this population. Our data indicate that these mud turtles have a fairly small home range (no single movement more than 75m) with males generally moving more often and greater distances than females. The health of captured turtles is generally good, although feral pigs and human interactions (especially after national news events) appear to represent the greatest threats to the turtles. The population at Circle B does not appear to be dense, as we recapture many of the same turtles. However, after almost 2 years of sampling, we are still capturing unmarked turtles and the population is represented by multiple size classes from small juveniles to large females. Overall, the data we have collected is helping Circle B Bar Reserve understand more about their striped mud turtle population and expands their knowledge of the wildlife they protect. With specific knowledge on the population size and habitat use, Circle B and other reserves/parks in central Florida can better accommodate small, often overlooked aquatic turtles into their management plans.

However, the energy costs of flying are considerably higher than those of resting. Therefore, when birds fly off after a disturbance, they use extra energy that subsequently needs to be compensated. We measured flight durations of the white-fronted goose, the most common (grass-eating) species wintering in western Europe, by high-frequency accelerometer recordings and made direct observations on these days to determine whether the flight durations were reliably recorded. Using both a simple and a more realistic model of the energy balance, we calculated the extra grass consumption resulting from additional intentional disturbances.
On average, the geese flew daily 2 × 323 s (from and to their roosting sites at 3200 m), and furthermore took to the air 5.3 times during a day (and 1.9 times a night). Multiplied with the average flight durations of 195 s, this gives a total flying time of almost 0.6 h day-1 and a total foraging time of 7.4 h day-1. With an intentional disturbance rate e.g. of five times a day, the birds’ compensation for the increased energy expenditure will lead to a higher overall consumption of grass of 11.5–16 % day-1. Accommodation schemes have to take such increases in total grass consumption into account when deciding on the refuge areas to be set aside.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2015-02-06 00:00:06.000,2015-03-06 23:30:06.000,2914,"Anser albifrons","GPS,Acceleration","andreakoelzsch (Andrea Kölzsch)"

Tøttrup","Protandry, the earlier arrival of males at the breeding grounds relative to females, is common in migratory birds. However, due to difficulties in following individual birds on migration, we still lack knowledge about the spatiotemporal origin of protandry during the annual cycle, impeding our understanding of the proximate drivers of this phenomenon. Here, we use full annual cycle tracking data of red-backed shrikes Lanius collurio to investigate the occurrence of sex-related differences in migratory pattern, which could be viewed as precursors (proximate causes) to protandry. We find protandry with males arriving an estimated 8.3 days (SE = 4.1) earlier at the breeding area than females. Furthermore, we find that, averaged across all departure and arrival events throughout the annual cycle, males migrate an estimated 5.3 days earlier than females during spring compared to 0.01 days in autumn. Event-wise estimates suggest that a divergence between male and female migratory schedules is initiated at departure from the main non-breeding area, thousands of kilometres from, and several months prior to arrival at the breeding area. Duration of migration, flight speed during migration and spatial locations of stationary sites were similar between sexes. Our results reveal that protandry might arise from sex-differential migratory schedules emerging at the departure from the main non-breeding area in southern Africa and retained throughout spring migration, supporting the view that sex-differential selection pressure operates during spring migration rather than autumn migration.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2009-06-24 20:35:00.000,2016-02-29 17:21:00.000,18511,"Lanius collurio","Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw,Solar Geolocator Twilight","lypedersen (Lykke Pedersen)"

Even for the best-studied dispersal system of the Neotropics, Virola nobilis, the dispersal kernel remains unknown. We combined high-resolution GPS/3D-acceleration bird tracking, seed retention experiments, and field observations to quantify dispersal of V. nobilis by their principal dispersers, Ramphastos toucans. We inferred feeding events from movement data, and then estimated spatio-temporally explicit seed-dispersal kernels. Toucans moved an average of 1.8 km d-1 with two distinct activity peaks. Seed retention time averaged 25.5 min (range 4-98 min). Estimated seed dispersal distance averaged 144±147m, with a 56% likelihood of dispersal >100m; this is 2X further than the behaviour-naive estimate from the same data. Dispersal was furthest for seeds ingested in the morning (morning mean 152±154m, midday mean 95±83m), and increased with seed retention time, but only up to 60 min after feeding. Our study supports the long-standing hypothesis that toucans are excellent dispersers of Virola seeds. To maximize seed dispersal distances trees should ripen fruit in the morning when birds move the most, and produce fruits with gut-processing times around 60 min. We also demonstrate how new tracking technology can yield nuanced seed dispersal kernels for animals that cannot be directly observed.","research",true,true,false,true,false,"na",2007-12-08 21:31:31.998,2007-12-16 15:15:24.000,2480,"Pteroglossus torquatus,Ramphastos sulfuratus,Ramphastos swainsonii","GPS,Acceleration","Rolandisimo (Roland Kays)"

The acoustic lek mating behavior of the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) in the Congo basin was first described in the 1970s. More recently molecular testing implicated this species and other African bats as potential reservoir hosts for Ebola virus and it was one of only two fruit bat species epidemiologically linked to the 2008 Luebo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ebola outbreak. Here we share findings from the first pilot study of hammer-headed bat movement using GPS tracking and accelerometry units and a small preceding radio-tracking trial at an apparent lekking site. The radio-tracking revealed adult males had high rates of nightly visitation to the site compared to females (only one visit) and that two of six females day-roosted ~100 m west of Libonga, the nearest village that is ~1.6 km southwest. Four months later, in mid-April 2018, five individual bats, comprised of four males and one female, were tracked from two to 306 days, collecting from 67 to 1022 GPS locations. As measured by mean distance to the site and proportion of nightly GPS locations within 1 km of the site (percent visitation), the males were much more closely associated with the site (mean distance 1.4 km; 51% visitation), than the female (mean 5.5 km; 2.2% visitation). Despite the small sample size, our tracking evidence supports our original characterization of the site as a lek, and the lek itself is much more central to male than female movement. Moreover, our pilot demonstrates the technical feasibility of executing future studies on hammer-headed bats that will help fill problematic knowledge gaps about zoonotic spillover risks and the conservation needs of fruit bats across the continent.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2018-04-12 17:00:41.000,2019-02-15 17:00:47.000,9428,"Hypsignathus monstrosus","GPS,Acceleration","abbayaa (Sarah Olson)"

Adults, males and higher quality individuals typically arrive earlier, and across years, early arrival has been linked to warmer spring temperatures. However, the mechanisms and potential costs of early arrival are not well understood. 
(2) To deepen the understanding of arrival date differences between individuals and years, we studied them in light of the preceding spring migration behaviour and atmospheric conditions en route. 
(3) GPS and body‐acceleration (ACC) data were obtained for 35 adult white storks (Ciconia ciconia) over five years (2012‐2016). ACC records were translated to energy expenditure estimates (Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration; ODBA) and to behavioural modes, and GPS fixes were coupled with environmental parameters. 
(4) At the inter‐individual level (within years), early arrival was attributed primarily to departing earlier for migration and from more northern wintering sites (closer to breeding grounds), rather than to migration speed. In fact, early departing birds flew slower, experienced weaker thermal uplifts and expended more energy during flight, but still arrived earlier, emphasizing the cost and the significance of early departure. Individuals that wintered further south arrived later at the breeding grounds but did not produce fewer fledglings, presumably due to positive carry‐over effects of advantageous wintering conditions (increased precipitation, vegetation productivity and daylight time). Therefore, early arrival increased breeding success only after controlling for wintering latitude. Males arrived slightly ahead of females. Between years, late arrival was linked to colder temperatures en route through two different mechanisms: stronger headwinds causing slower migration and lower thermal uplifts resulting in longer stopovers. 
(5) This study showed that distinct migratory properties underlie arrival time variation within and between years. It highlighted: (a) an overlooked cost of early arrival induced by unfavourable atmospheric conditions during migration, (b) an important fitness trade‐off in storks between arrival date and wintering habitat quality, and (c) mechanistic explanations for the negative temperature‐arrival date correlation in soaring birds. Such understanding of arrival time can facilitate forecasting migrating species responses to climate changes.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2012-01-22 02:00:44.000,2016-06-04 20:00:10.000,1207130,"Ciconia ciconia","GPS,Acceleration,Accessory Measurements","shay.rotics"

As a consequence a large number of the seeds from the fruit they feed upon germinate in the cave and spoil. Here we use newly developed GPS/acceleration loggers with remote UHF readout to show that several assumptions about the behaviour of Steatornis caripensis need to be revised. On average, they spend only every 3(rd) day in a cave, individuals spent most days sitting quietly in trees in the rainforest where they regurgitate seeds. This provides new data on the extent of seed dispersal and the movement ecology of Steatornis caripensis. It suggests that Steatornis caripensis is perhaps the most important long-distance seed disperser in Neotropical forests.

Differences in size and environmental characteristics of ontogenetic habitats can lead to differences in movement patterns, behaviour, habitat use and spatial distributions across individuals of the same species. Knowledge of juvenile loggerhead turtles’ dispersal, movements and habitat use is largely unknown, especially in the Mediterranean Sea. Satellite relay data loggers were used to monitor movements, diving behaviour and water temperature of eleven large juvenile loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) deliberately caught in an oceanic habitat in the Mediterranean Sea. Hidden Markov Models were used over 4430 spatial locations to quantify the different activities performed by each individual: transit, low and high intensity diving. Model results were then analysed in relation to water temperature, bathymetry and distance to the coast. The Hidden Markov Model differentiated between bouts of Area Restricted Search as low and high intensity diving, and transit movements. The turtles foraged in deep oceanic waters within 60 km from the coast as well as above 140 km from the coast. They used an average area of 194802 km2, where most individuals used the deepest part of the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea with the highest seamounts, while only two switched to neritic foraging showing plasticity in foraging strategies among turtles of similar age classes. The foraging distribution of large juvenile loggerhead turtles, including some which were of the minimum size of adults, in the Tyrrhenian Sea is mainly concentrated in a relatively small oceanic area with predictable mesoscale oceanographic features, despite the proximity of suitable neritic foraging habitats. Our study highlights the importance of collecting high-resolution data about species distribution and behaviour across different spatio-temporal scales and life stages for implementing conservation and Dynamic Ocean Management actions.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2016-10-13 22:00:00.000,2020-10-20 03:00:08.000,17582,"Caretta caretta","GPS,Argos Doppler Shift","shochscheid (Sandra Hochscheid)"

A recent experiment on Atlantic shearwaters (Cory’s shearwater, Calonectris borealis) breeding in the Azores indicated a crucial role of olfaction over the open ocean, but left open the question of whether birds might navigate by topographical landmark cues when available. Our experiment was conducted in the Mediterranean sea, where the availability of topographical cues may provide an alternative navigational mechanism for homing. Magnetically disturbed shearwaters and control birds oriented homeward even when the coast was not visible and rapidly homed. Anosmic shearwaters oriented in a direction significantly different from the home direction when in open sea. After having approached a coastline their flight path changed from convoluted to homeward oriented, so that most of them eventually reached home.

We differentiated seven classes of land cover—alfalfa, annually rotated irrigated crops, developed, grassland, orchard / vineyard, rice, and water. From 2011–2013, we fitted transmitters with global positioning systems to 23 adult Swainson’s Hawks. We recorded a minimum of six locations per day per bird from spring through early autumn of each year. We used a fixed, bivariate-normal kernel estimator to calculate a utilization distribution at 30-m resolution for each life stage of each individual within each year. We used a linear mixed model to estimate the associations between intensity of space use and land cover, sex, and reproductive status. The majority of adult Swainson’s Hawks traveled distances up to 8–10 km from the nest throughout the breeding season. Median seasonal home-range sizes in a given year ranged from 87–172 km2. The association between intensity of space use and grassland was 50–139% stronger, and the association between intensity of space use and alfalfa 23–59% stronger, than the associations between intensity of space use and any other land-cover type. Intensity of space use did not vary as a function of sex, reproductive status, or life stage. Given our results and additional knowledge of the species’ ecology, we suggest that reproductive success and, in turn, population-level recruitment may be associated equally if not more closely with availability of nesting sites than with the current distribution of land cover.

Studies of flight and its impact on the movement ecology of birds must consider the wind to help us understand aerodynamics and bird flight strategies. Here, we introduce a systematic approach to evaluate wind speed and direction from the high-frequency GPS recordings from bird-borne tags during thermalling flight. Our method assumes that a fixed horizontal mean wind speed during a short (18 seconds, 19 GPS fixes) flight segment with a constant turn angle along a closed loop, characteristic of thermalling flight, will generate a fixed drift for each consequent location. We use a maximum-likelihood approach to estimate that drift and to determine the wind and airspeeds at the birds' flight locations. We also provide error estimates for these GPS-derived wind speed estimates. We validate our approach by comparing its wind estimates with the mid-resolution weather reanalysis data from ECMWF, and by examining independent wind estimates from pairs of birds in a large dataset of GPS-tagged migrating storks that were flying in close proximity. Our approach provides accurate and unbiased observations of wind speed and additional detailed information on vertical winds and uplift structure. These precise measurements are otherwise rare and hard to obtain and will broaden our understanding of atmospheric conditions, flight aerodynamics, and bird flight strategies. With an increasing number of GPS-tracked animals, we may soon be able to use birds to inform us about the atmosphere they are flying through and thus improve future ecological and environmental studies.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2014-08-01 02:00:23.000,2014-10-01 21:00:07.000,7149404,"Ciconia ciconia","GPS,Acceleration","aflack (Andrea Flack)"

The spatial structure and dynamic properties of animal migrations and population flyways largely determine those trophic and transport effects, but are yet poorly studied. As a basis, we propose a periodic Markov model on the spatial migration network of breeding, stopover and wintering sites to formally describe the process of animal migration on the population level. From seasonally changing transition rates we derived stable, seasonal densities of animals at the network nodes. We parametrized the model with high-quality GPS and satellite telemetry tracks of white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and greater white-fronted geese (Anser a. albifrons). Topological and network flow properties of the two derived networks conform to migration properties like seasonally changing connectivity and shared, directed movement. Thus, the model realistically describes the migration movement of complete populations and can become an important tool to study the effects of climate and habitat change and pathogen spread on migratory animals. Furthermore, the property of periodically changing transition rates makes it a new type of complex model and we need to understand its dynamic properties.

After solar-powered transmitters became available in 1995, extended battery life combined with the possibility to replace transmitters over time allowed monitoring the movements of individual storks across multiple migration seasons, with one individual, Prinzesschen, tracked for over a decade. Research efforts continue using primarily GSM-based tracking technologies. This dataset includes over 200 storks tagged in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Israel, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain and Switzerland. As noted in the deployment information, some movements are influenced by experimental manipulations. This long-term study confirms what previous several-year tracking studies of white storks had indicated: there can be great variability from year to year in the choice of winter quarters as well as in the routes and times of migration, intermediate destinations and stop-over periods, but constancy of winter quarters and migration routes is also possible. The variability may well be caused by external factors, of which food supply is probably predominant.<br><br>

Behav.: Many animals show sex differences in foraging behaviour, which can be related to sex-specific size dimorphism, avoidance of intersexual competition for depletable resources or different energetic requirements of males and females. In southern rockhopper penguins, Eudyptes chrysocome, both sexes differ in their roles during breeding, which leads to differences in their energetic requirements. We therefore examined sex differences in the foraging behaviour of southern rockhopper penguins during the incubation period, using GPS and timeedepth data, stable isotope analysis and an automated weighbridge system. While males carried out mostly long trips lasting several days, females often used coastal foraging areas on day trips. Stable isotope data suggested differences in prey composition between the sexes, with consistently higher trophic levels in males as expected for their larger size and ability to catch larger prey items. We applied ecological niche models to compare the environmental conditions in the utilized incubation season habitat between the sexes, using MaxEnt modelling. MaxEnt models suggested that the niche spaces of males and females are largely overlapping, but males have slightly larger niche width. The most important environmental parameter was sea surface temperature. The different energetic requirements related to the birds’ incubation and chick-provisioning pattern seem to be the driving force behind the observed spatial segregation. Males make use of highly productive areas to prepare for subsequent fasting periods whereas females forage in coastal waters for themselves as well as for the chicks during the subsequent guard stage. PLoS One: Logger technology has revolutionised our knowledge of the behaviour and physiology of free-living animals but handling and logger attachments may have negative effects on the behaviour of the animals and their welfare. We studied southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) females during the guard stage in three consecutive breeding seasons (2008/ 0922010/11) to evaluate the effects of handling and logger attachment on foraging trip duration, dive behaviour and physiological parameters. Smaller dive loggers (TDRs) were used in 2010/11 for comparison to larger GPS data loggers used in all three seasons and we included two categories of control birds: handled controls and PIT control birds that were previously marked with passive integrative transponders (PITs), but which had not been handled during this study. Increased foraging trip duration was only observed in GPS birds during 2010/11, the breeding season in which we also found GPS birds foraging further away from the colony and travelling longer distances. Compared to previous breeding seasons, 2010/11 may have been a period with less favourable environmental conditions, which would enhance the impact of logger attachments. A comparison between GPS and TDR birds showed a significant difference in dive depth frequencies with birds carrying larger GPS data loggers diving shallower. Mean and maximum dive depths were similar between GPS and TDR birds. We measured little impact of logger attachments on physiological parameters (corticosterone, protein, triglyceride levels and leucocyte counts). Overall, handling and short-term logger attachments (1–3 days) showed limited impact on the behaviour and physiology of the birds but care must be taken with the size of data loggers on diving seabirds. Increased drag may alter their diving behaviour substantially, thus constraining them in their ability to catch prey. Results obtained in this study indicate that data recorded may also not represent their normal dive behaviour.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2010-11-14 22:00:37.000,2011-01-23 22:31:54.000,61523,"Eudyptes chrysocome","GPS","masello (Masello)"

Plasticity in movement strategies allows a species to better track spatial dynamics of habitat quality. We describe the mechanisms that shape the movement of a long-distance migrant bird (turkey vulture, Cathartes aura) across two continents using satellite tracking coupled with remote-sensing science. Using nearly 10 years of data from 24 satellite-tracked vultures in four distinct populations, we describe an enormous amount of variation in their movement patterns. We related vulture movement to environmental conditions and found important correlations explaining how far they need to move to find food (indexed by the normalized difference vegetation index) and how fast they can move based on the prevalence of thermals and temperature. We conclude that the extensive variability in the movement ecology of turkey vultures, facilitated by their energetically efficient thermal soaring, suggests that this species is likely to do well across periods of modest climate change. The large scale and sample sizes needed for such analysis in a widespread migrant emphasizes the need for integrated and collaborative efforts to obtain tracking data and for policies, tools and open datasets to encourage such collaborations and data sharing.","research",true,true,false,true,false,"na",2003-11-14 16:00:00.000,2013-03-19 03:00:00.000,215719,"Cathartes aura","GPS","dbarber (David Barber)"

From the 42 individuals tracked we found that foraging trips encompassed large areas of Hecate Strait, to the east of the colonies, and that birds travelled on average 453 km in 4.3 days for each foraging trip in 2018, and on average 263 km in 3.0 days in 2019. We used hidden Markov models (HMMs) to identify three movement behaviour states from track characteristics, which we classified as transit, resting and foraging. Immersion data collected from the GPS tags allowed us to differentiate between the two slow-moving states, and confidently identify foraging movement behaviour. Validation of movement behaviour states using time of day and immersion data suggested HMMs successfully identified daytime foraging locations, although nighttime socializing or resting may have been misclassified as foraging. Our results can inform marine conservation of this vulnerable species by differentiating foraging from other at-sea movement behaviours, and is a first step to identifying critical foraging habitat. The methods applied in this study to classify movement behaviours using data from small GPS devices can be used in future studies of this species and other similar small, diving seabirds.

Gulls often use human-impacted landscapes and may respond to changes by altering their feeding ecology. We investigated the foraging behavior of individual common gulls (Larus canus), focusing on their distribution during foraging and their selected habitat types. We tracked adult common gulls using GPS telemetry at their largest breeding colony in the southwestern Baltic Sea, Germany. Foraging habitats were analyzed from tracking data for three breeding seasons 2016, 2017, and 2019 and were compared with potentially available foraging habitats. Most breeding birds flew toward terrestrial areas. Feeding sites were located on average 11.7–14.3 km from the colony (range 0.9–36.5 km). Corn and sugar beet fields were used significantly and extensively compared with their availability in 2016 and 2017, while wheat, rape, and barley fields were used significantly less. Data from 2019 suggested seasonal shifts in habitat use. Birds spent between 30 and 1300 min per week at their preferred feeding sites, with significant differences between the major habitats selected. We found a stable, clear, multiyear pattern in common gull foraging behavior in relation to agricultural practices. Fields with little or no crop cover and thus access to the soil were preferred over fields with high crop cover. These results suggest that local food availability may be limiting further population increases in this species.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2016-05-14 13:10:08.000,2025-11-20 12:02:27.000,1823831,"Larus canus","GPS,Acceleration","stefangarthe (Stefan Garthe)"

A predator’s habitat use is defined by its home range, which is influenced by its selection or avoidance of habitat features and intra- and inter-specific interactions within the landscape. These are driven by both innate and learned behaviour, operating at different spatial scales. We examined the seasonal home ranges and habitat selection of actively-managed populations of a native apex predator (dingo Canis dingo) and invasive mesopredator (feral cat Felis catus) in semi-arid Western Australia to better understanding their sympatric landscape use, potential interactions, and to help guide their management.   
Methods: We used kernel density estimates to characterise the seasonal space use of dingoes and feral cats, investigate inter- and intra-species variation in their home range extent and composition, and examine second-order habitat selection for each predator. Further, we used discrete choice modelling and step selection functions to examine the difference in third-order habitat selection across several habitat features.  
Results: The seasonal home ranges of dingoes were on average 19.5 times larger than feral cats. Feral cat seasonal home ranges typically included a larger proportion of grasslands than expected relative to availability in the study site, indicating second-order habitat selection for grasslands.  In their fine-scale movements (third-order habitat selection), both predators selected for roads, hydrological features (seasonal intermittent streams, seasonal lakes and wetlands), and high vegetation cover. Dingoes also selected strongly for open woodlands, whereas feral cats used open woodlands and grasslands in proportion to availability.  
Management Recommendations: Based on these results, and in order to avoid unintended negative ecological consequences (e.g. mesopredator release) that may stem from non-selective predator management, we recommend that feral cat control focuses on techniques such as trapping and shooting that are specific to feral cats in areas where they overlap with apex predators (dingoes), and more general techniques such as poison baiting where they are segregated.

They directly regulate herbivore populations, which in turn maintain grasslands and associated systems. Those ecosystems have degraded in recent decades and the concurrent decline in lion population is believed to play a role. I investigated factors affecting lion behaviour and ecology including the effect of seasonal variation in wild prey herd size. Current levels of herbivore prey are significantly lower than before the creation of countrywide veterinary cordon fences and total lean season biomass was estimated at 375.5 kg.km-2 . I placed GPS position locating radio collars on 13 lions in 6 prides in a study area of approximately 9,911 square kilometres in the north of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR), in central Botswana. The collars acquired total of 241,858 usable GPS fixes and I visited each lion monthly. Lion spatial behaviour appears to have changed in response to the decline in herbivores, although there is only a small amount of historical data. Lion home ranges were large (mean home range = 2116.5 km2 , range 798.3- 4243.7 km2 ) compared to two prides from a study in the 1970s in the same area which had home ranges of approximately 337 km2 . Those prides increased their range to today’s sizes only in severe drought years, but rainfall during the study period was high. I interpret this as evidence that seasonal lower herbivore densities have increased lion ranges, and reduced the number of lions in the CKGR. I estimate the current population in the study area at 307 adult lions, or 3.1 lions per 100km2 . During months of high herbivore group densities, lions travelled further on a daily basis (mean daily movement distance of 7,160 m at lowest density, to 8,616 m at the highest density), and males on average travelled significantly further each day than females (mean of 10,071.6m per day for male, SD = 7099.4, maximum 48,462m and a mean of 7,633.6m per day for females, SD= 5,069.3m, maximum 29,470m). Females moved similar distances daily even while supporting cubs under 3 months old. Lions significantly preferred hunting prey species above 90kg, but also hunted the smaller warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) and African porcupine (Hystrix africaeaustralis). This has implications for conflict mitigation and lion conservation. I investigate the economics and extent of the lion livestock conflict in Central Botswana and explore potential management options in light of this new data. Management options should be carefully selected with consideration for economics, politics and local conditions, and should target locations where conflict mitigation can have the greatest benefit for both lion conservation and economic improvement of stakeholders in order to have the best chance for success. After carefully examining the ecology of the Central Kalahari lions and the management of the reserve and farms in the area, I conclude that mitigating lion-livestock conflict is best achieved through improving grazing practices and not a change in reserve management.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2008-12-15 05:00:00.000,2012-04-04 21:00:00.000,241760,"Panthera leo","GPS","Heinsohn (Robert Heinsohn)"

","jim.roth@umanitoba.ca","James D. Roth","Background: Range expansion of species, a major consequence of climate changes, may alter communities substantially due to competition between expanding and native species. 
Methods: We first quantified size differences between an expanding habitat generalist, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and a circumpolar habitat specialist, the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), at the edge of the Arctic, where climate-related changes occur rapidly, to predict the likelihood of the larger competitor escalating interference to intraguild killing. We then used satellite telemetry to evaluate competition in a heterogeneous landscape by examining space use early during the foxes' reproductive period, when resource scarcity, increased-food requirements and spatial constraints likely exacerbate the potential for interference. We used time-LoCoH to quantify space and habitat use, and Minta's index to quantify spatio-temporal interactions between neighbors.
Results: Our morphometric comparison involving 236 foxes found that the potential for escalated interference between these species was high due to intermediate size difference. Our results from 17 collared foxes suggested that expanding and native competitors may coexist when expanding species occur at low densities. Low home-range overlap between neighbors suggested territoriality and substantial exploitation competition for space. No obvious differential use of areas shared by heterospecific neighbors suggested low interference. If anything, intraspecific competition between red foxes may be stronger than interspecific competition. Red and Arctic foxes used habitat differentially, with near-exclusive use of forest patches by red foxes and marine habitats by Arctic foxes.
Conclusion: Heterogeneous landscapes may relax interspecific competition between expanding and native species, allowing exclusive use of some resources. Furthermore, the scarcity of habitats favored by expanding species may emphasize intraspecific competition between newcomers over interspecific competition, thus creating the potential for self-limitation of expanding populations. Dominant expanding competitors may benefit from interference, but usually lack adaptations to abiotic conditions at their expansion front, favoring rear-edge subordinate species in exploitation competition. However, due to ongoing climate change, systems are usually not at equilibrium. A spread of habitats and resources favorable to expanding species may promote higher densities of antagonistically dominant newcomers, which may lead to extirpation of native species.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2017-05-09 00:00:00.000,2020-06-15 18:00:00.000,12840,"Vulpes vulpes,Vulpes lagopus","GPS","Churchill Fox Project (Chloé Warret Rodrigues)"

Adult Marbled Murrelets were captured at night on the water during the pre-laying period (April 2014) in Wright Sound, near Hartley Bay, BC. Six birds were tagged with 5 g solar satellite transmitters. We had short-lived or no detections for two birds, detections for two weeks for three birds, and detections throughout the breeding season and beyond for one bird whose tag continued to transmit signals. Marine habitat use in relation to three alternative proposed tanker routes was examined for individual murrelets by using kernel density estimation to generate probability density functions of location, incorporating Argos location errors. Areas of high, medium and low encounter probabilities for each bird were generated. Use of marine habitats, coupled with a large population of birds in the area during the breeding season, suggests that there is a strong potential for interaction between tankers and murrelets along the proposed routes. However, based on the movement of one bird to south-central Alaska, individuals may migrate out of the area, reducing the likelihood of interactions post-breeding.

We examined the marine distributions of Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) breeding on Triangle Island, in the Northeast Pacific off the coast of B.C., Canada using surveys conducted in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Concurrently, we sampled zooplankton at 16 stations along a cross shelf transect in the vicinity of Triangle Island. In 1999 and 2000, when populations of the preferred copepod prey Neocalanus cristatus were available at deep-water stations (1000–2000 m), the majority of the auklets were concentrated SW of the colony 40–75 km offshore and parallel to, but 35 −50 km beyond the shelf break in deep water (1200–2000 m). Birds did not fly farther out to sea to where prey was five times more abundant when N. cristatus could be found at lower abundance levels, closer to the colony. In 2001, N. cristatus were virtually absent at the deep-water stations, likely as a result of massive salp (family Salpidae) aggregations which may have consumed and displaced the seabirds’ preferred prey. We demonstrate that while birds were still able to locate and provision chicks with N. cristatus in 2001, they had to forage farther away from the colony in order to do so. Our telemetry results are generally consistent with analyses of at-sea distributions of Cassin's Auklets derived from ship-board surveys (1990–2010) both of which have contributed to the design of the proposed Scott Islands marine National Wildlife Area, the first of its kind in Canada.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",1999-06-10 19:00:00.000,2001-06-07 19:00:00.000,117,"Ptychoramphus aleuticus","Radio Transmitter","bertramd (Doug Bertram)"

Here, we show that an outbreak of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus (HPAIV) coincided with unprecedented short-term behavioural changes in Northern gannets (Morus bassanus). Breeding gannets show characteristically strong fidelity to their nest sites and foraging areas (2015–2019; n = 120), but during the 2022 HPAIV outbreak, GPS-tagged gannets instigated long-distance movements beyond well-documented previous ranges and the first ever recorded visits of GPS-tagged adults to other gannet breeding colonies. Our findings suggest that the HPAIV outbreak triggered changes in space use patterns of exposed individuals that amplified the epidemiological connectivity among colonies and may generate super-spreader events that accelerate disease transmission across the metapopulation. Such self-propagating transmission from and towards high density animal aggregations may explain the unexpectedly rapid pan-European spread of HPAIV in the gannet.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2022-04-29 09:57:14.000,2022-09-13 22:57:58.000,48642,"Morus bassanus","GPS","JWEJeglinski (Jana W E Jeglinski)"

These movements are relatively well understood at a population level, but how individual insects achieve them remains elusive. Behavioral responses to conditions en route are little studied, primarily owing to the challenges of tracking individual insects. Using a light aircraft and individual radio tracking, we show that nocturnally migrating death’s-head hawkmoths maintain control of their flight trajectories over long distances. The moths did not just fly with favorable tailwinds; during a given night, they also adjusted for head and crosswinds to precisely hold course. This behavior indicates that the moths use a sophisticated internal compass to maintain seasonally beneficial migratory trajectories independent of wind conditions, illuminating how insects traverse long distances to take advantage of seasonal resources.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2018-09-10 18:30:00.000,2019-10-14 16:12:36.000,274,"Acherontiini ","Radio Transmitter","martin (Martin Wikelski)"

We collected tissue samples for genetic analyses on five breeding colonies in the western Pacific Ocean (Japan) and on 13 colonies in the eastern Pacific Ocean (California to Alaska), and deployed light-level geolocator tags on 12 eastern Pacific colonies to delineate wintering areas. Geolocator tags were deployed previously on one colony in Japan. There was strong genetic differentiation between populations in the eastern vs. western Pacific Ocean, likely due to two factors. First, glaciation over the North Pacific in the late Pleistocene might have forced a southward range shift that historically isolated the eastern and western populations. And second, deep-ocean habitat along the northern continental shelf appears to act as a barrier to movement; abundant on both sides of the North Pacific, the rhinoceros auklet is virtually absent as a breeder in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, and no tagged birds crossed the North Pacific in the non-breeding season. While genetic differentiation was strongest between the eastern vs. western Pacific, there was also extensive differentiation within both regional groups. In pairwise comparisons among the eastern Pacific colonies, the standardized measure of genetic differentiation (FꞌST)was negatively correlated with the extent of spatial overlap in wintering areas. That result supports the hypothesis that segregation in the non-breeding season is linked to genetic structure. Philopatry and neritic foraging habit probably also contribute to the structuring. Widely distributed, vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors, and exhibiting extensive genetic structure, the rhinoceros auklet is fully indicative of the scope of the conservation challenges posed by seabirds.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2014-05-15 19:00:34.000,2017-05-04 19:01:36.000,45450,"Cerorhinca monocerata","Solar Geolocator,Accessory Measurements,Solar Geolocator Raw","vpattison (Vivian Pattison)"

The northern gannet (Morus bassanus) was one of the most affected species, with tens of thousands of casualties in the northeast Atlantic between April–September 2022. Disease outbreaks can modify the movement ecology of animals by diminishing spatial consistency, thereby increasing the potential for disease transmission. To detect potential changes in movement behaviour, we GPS-tracked breeding adults following the initial HPAIV outbreak, at three of the largest northern gannet breeding colonies where major mortality of adults and chicks occurred (Bass Rock, Scotland, UK; Grassholm, Wales, UK; Rouzic, Brittany, France). We also gathered background epidemiological information and northern gannet colony dynamics during the outbreak. Our data indicate that HPAIV killed at least 50 % of northern gannets, and suggest the presence of HPAIV H5N1 antibodies in juveniles. GPS-tracked adult northern gannets remained faithful to their breeding sites despite the HPAIV outbreak and did not prospect other breeding colonies. They performed regular foraging trips at sea, similar to their behaviour before the outbreak. Comparison with GPS-tracking data gathered in 2019, i.e. before the HPAIV outbreak, suggested lower foraging effort in birds which survived HPAIV in 2022, potentially as a consequence of reduced intra- and interspecific food competition. Breeding colony fidelity of surviving adult northern gannets following HPAIV mass-mortalities indicates limited capacity for viral spread during our study. This may contrast with the behaviour of adults during the initial disease outbreak, and with that of younger individuals.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2022-08-11 07:08:59.000,2022-09-29 22:58:48.000,39216,"Morus bassanus","GPS","JWEJeglinski (Jana W E Jeglinski)"

musculus; four females, three males, one of unknown sex), and five fin whales (B.
physalus; two females, one male, two of unknown sex) off southern California, USA,
in summer 2014 and 2015. Tags logged 1-Hz data from tri-axial accelerometers,
magnetometers, and a depth sensor, while acquiring Fastloc GPS locations. Tag
attachment duration ranged from 18.3 to 28.9 d for blue whales and 4.9–16.0 d
for fin whales, recording 1,030–4,603 dives and 95–3,338 GPS locations per whale
across both species. Feeding lunges (identified from accelerometer data) were used
to characterize “feeding bouts” (i.e., sequences of feeding dives with <60 min of
consecutive non-feeding dives), within-bout behavior, and to examine the spatial
distribution of feeding effort. Whales fed near the tagging locations (Point Mugu and
San Miguel Island) for up to 7 d before dispersing as far south as Ensenada, Mexico,
and north to Cape Mendocino, California. Dispersal within southern California waters
differed by sex in both species with males undertaking offshore, circuitous excursions,
while females remained more coastal, suggesting that movement patterns on the feeding
grounds may not be exclusively related to energy gain. Feeding bout characteristics
were similar for both species, with the median bout having 24 dives and lasting 3.3 h
for blue whales (n = 242), and 19 dives while lasting 2.7 h for fin whales (n = 59). Bout
duration was positively correlated with the number of feeding lunges per dive within a
bout for both species, suggesting whales left poor-quality prey patches quickly but fed
intensively for up to 34.9 h when prey was abundant. Feeding bouts occurred further
apart as the distance from shore increased, but there was no corresponding difference
in the number of feeding lunges per dive, suggesting the whales were feeding at the
same rate throughout their range, but that prey was more dispersed in offshore waters.
This may be evidence of two feeding strategies, with spatially aggregated foraging around
highly localized, topographically forced upwelling centers nearshore, and more dispersed
foraging in larger areas of elevated, but patchy, productivity offshore.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2014-08-04 18:44:30.000,2015-08-06 20:34:53.000,17150,"Balaenoptera physalus,Balaenoptera musculus","GPS","mmiwtg (Barb Lagerquist)"

However, the actual migratory path and whales’ behaviour in these locations are poorly known. The objectives of this study were to apply a switching state-space model to the satellite tracks of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus in the Northeast Pacific to improve location estimation and gain insight into the migratory (transiting) and foraging (area-restricted search, ARS) behaviours of this population. During the period 1993 to 2007, Argos satellite tags were attached to 159 whales, mainly off the coast of California during late summer, of which 92 tracks were >7 d in duration. There was generally a southward movement during the winter to Baja California and to an area west of the Costa Rica Dome, in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP). Travel speeds during transit were significantly faster than during ARS movements (mean = 3.70 and 1.05 km h^–1, respectively). On average, 29% of the track time was spent in ARS, and the mean time within an ARS patch was 21 d. The occurrence of ARS behaviour throughout the migration cycle suggests that these animals may forage year-round, but could also indicate limited movements during the reproductive season. The extent of their northward migration from Baja California to Washington varied significantly interannually, likely in response to environmental changes affecting their prey. The long track durations obtained from electronic tagging have provided essential new information about the critical habitats of Northeast Pacific blue whales.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",1993-08-29 01:23:17.000,2009-04-10 12:34:34.000,15545,"Balaenoptera musculus","GPS,Argos Doppler Shift","mmiwtg (Barb Lagerquist)"

Animals frequently forage in groups on ephemeral resources to profit from social information and increased efficiency. Greater spear-nosed bats, Phyllostomus hastatus, develop group-specific social calls, which are hypothesized to coordinate social foraging to feed on patchily distributed balsa flowers. To test this, we tagged all members of three social groups of P. hastatus on Isla Colon, Panama, using high-frequency GPS during a season when balsa had begun to flower. We found that bats commuted 20-30 km to foraging sites, more than double the distance reported previously. In contrast to our expectations, we found that tagged individuals did not commute together, but did join group members in small foraging patches with high densities of flowering balsas on the mainland. We hypothesized that close proximity to group members would increase foraging efficiency if social foraging were used to find flower clusters, but distance between tagged individuals did not predict foraging efficiency or energy expenditure. However, decreased distance among tagged bats positively influenced the time spent outside roosting caves and increased the duration and synchrony of resting. These results suggest that social proximity appears to be more important during resting and that factors other than increased feeding efficiency may structure social relationships of group members while foraging. It appears that, depending on the local resource landscape, these bats have an excellent map even of distant resources and may use social information only for current patch discovery. They then may no longer rely on social information during daily foraging.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",,,,"Bos taurus,Phyllostomus hastatus","GPS","teague_o (Teague O'Mara)"

Maintaining connectivity requires preserving or restoring patches of habitat, accounting for the behavioral factors that determine movement between patches and mitigating threats. We measured natural and anthropogenic features that influence movement and mortality for bobcats (Lynx rufus) in a system threatened with complete isolation by urbanization. Our overarching objective was to inform local land acquisition and restoration to maintain two last-chance wildlife corridors. We collected five-minute movement data from 36 bobcats in central California to assess features of road-crossing hotspots and model habitat selection, including functional responses to housing densities and vegetation. We collected opportunistic mortalities and assessed rat poison exposure to evaluate edge effects as acute threats. Bobcats strongly selected for natural vegetation, evident at the level of a single tree or shrub. Individuals selected low-density housing (<5 houses/ha) yet avoided high-density housing development and monoculture agriculture. Narrow (<25 m wide) riparian strips were critical to connectivity. Bobcats successfully crossed the busiest highway in the landscape but frequently died when crossing a less-trafficked road with a high median barrier. Vehicles and disease were dominant sources of mortality, while 94% of bobcats were exposed to rat poisons despite California's 2014 regulations implemented to reduced wildlife exposure. Maintaining landscape connectivity requires conserving key habitats, mitigating the effects of infrastructure, and sustaining populations of highly mobile, healthy individuals. Our findings have driven conservation action through land acquisition. We demonstrate how robust, rapid data collection can facilitate real-world conservation outcomes.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2017-06-03 21:00:27.000,2018-12-29 07:55:08.000,647712,"Lynx rufus,Urocyon cinereoargenteus","GPS,Acceleration","ucsc@bobcat (Laurel Serieys)"

In the wet grassland habitats where waders breed, wildlife managers work to mitigate fox predation risk to waders during the nesting period through lethal and non-lethal control methods. However, limited knowledge on fox movement ecology in these habitats makes it difficult to design effective management strategies. We used GPS telemetry to understand fox home range size, daily activity and movement patterns, and how these metrics may vary among wet grassland sites with different management. We caught and GPS-tagged 35 foxes in the March–June wader nesting period on two wet grassland sites in central southern England; Britford during 2016/17 and Somerley during 2018/19. We estimated home range areas from location data using local convex hulls, and from these estimates we derived the minimum fox density at each site and year. Daily activity patterns and movement behaviour of each fox were obtained using both telemetry and trail camera data. Mean fox home range area at Britford (0.21 km2, SE = 0.025) was significantly smaller than at Somerley (0.68 km2, SE = 0.067), and estimated minimum densities were around four times higher (Britford = 10.6 foxes/km2, Somerley = 2.4 foxes/km2). Foxes were more active and moved faster during twilight and night hours, but both telemetry and camera data indicate they were also active for one-third of daylight hours. Distances moved per day were variable between foxes but generally smaller at Britford. We also found evidence for dispersal during spring, with movements of up to 19 km per day. Home ranges at both wet grassland sites were smaller than comparable sites elsewhere. These indicated foxes were living at exceptionally high densities at Britford, where there is no fox control, increased food availability and where waders no longer breed. Spatio-temporal movement patterns were closely related to home range metrics, with higher levels of fox activity at Somerley, where home ranges were larger. The movements of itinerant and dispersing foxes during the nesting period suggests that lethal control would need to be very intensive to be effective. The likely anthropogenic food subsidy of fox density at Britford suggests that controlling access to similar food resources would help reduce predation pressure on breeding waders.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2016-03-16 06:32:00.000,2019-07-04 20:00:00.000,146072,"Vulpes vulpes","GPS","taporteus (Tom Porteus)"

It is still poorly understood how urban areas affect wildlife space-use patterns and consistent intra-specific behavioral differences (i.e., behavioral types; BTs), which in turn shape various ecological processes. To address these questions, we investigated the movements of a common resident wader, the spur-winged lapwing (Vanellus spinosus), hypothesizing that urban individuals will be more mobile than rural ones. We used an ATLAS tracking system to track many (n=135) individuals at a high resolution (8 second-fix interval) over several months each. We first established that daily movement indices show consistent differences among individuals, acting as spatial-BTs. Then focusing on the two main principle-components of lapwings’ daily-movements – mobility and position along the exploration-exploitation gradient– we investigated how these BTs are shaped by urbanization, season (nesting vs. non-nesting), and sex. We found that urban lapwings were indeed more mobile in both seasons. Furthermore, urban females were less explorative than rural females, especially during the nesting season. These results highlight how urbanization affects wildlife behavior, even of apparently urban-resilient avian residents. This underscores the need to consider possible behavioral consequences that are only apparent through advanced tracking methods.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2020-04-01 00:00:08.000,2023-03-26 04:59:59.000,128357000,"Vanellus spinosus","Radio Transmitter,ATLAS Geolocation","mikibarziv (Michael Bar-Ziv)"

Until recently, little was known about the marine ecology of fjord-breeding tawaki and how access to the fjord environment may impact the species’ foraging strategies. We conducted a comparative study of foraging behaviour in chick-rearing tawaki from colonies located at the entrance and further inside Piopiotahi/Milford Sound, one of New Zealand’s 14 fjords. Through the attachment of GPS/dive data loggers, dive parameters were examined to determine behavioural differences between the inner fjord colony (Harrison Cove) and the outer fjord colony (Moraine) during 2019 and 2020. Although situated only 8 km from each other, the two colonies showed markedly different foraging preferences, with Moraine birds almost exclusively foraging outside the fjord in both years, while Harrison Cove birds primarily foraged within the fjord in 2020 but not in 2019. Tawaki from each colony also displayed contrasting dive behaviour across years, either adopting a strategy of deeper dives with fast velocities, (Harrison Cove in 2019, Moraine in 2020) or shallower dives with slower velocities (Moraine in 2019, Harrison Cove in 2020). Foraging activity and efficiency for both colonies appeared to be greater in 2020 than 2019, although birds foraged differently to achieve this – Harrison Cove birds dived primarily to depths of 0-20m whereas Moraine birds switched between shallow dives, and deeper dives to 60-120m of the water column. Notably different environmental conditions in both the ocean and fjord in 2019 versus 2020 may have contributed to the behavioural differences across years. These findings highlight that tawaki possess considerable plasticity in their foraging behaviours which could be advantageous for their future survival in a changing climate.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2019-09-30 10:20:52.000,2020-10-03 23:01:38.000,14541,"Eudyptes pachyrhynchus","GPS","Myrene_O (Myrene Otis)"

To support these populations, feeding stations are used to increase food availability and to supply food without antibiotics and toxic compounds. Yet, supplying food at feeding stations may affect vulture behavior. We present a large-scale field experiment testing how different food provision schemes affected the movement of Egyptian Vultures (Neophron percnopterus). We used GPS transmitters harnessed to 18 vulture chicks and described their movements post-fledging. We categorized the vultures into 3 groups according to the feeding scheme used at feeding stations near their nests: frequent and spatially dispersed food supply (FD); non-frequent and spatially dispersed food supply (NFD); and frequent food supply, concentrated in one location (FC). We found that birds from all three groups increased their roosting distances from the nest with fledgling age, with the NFD and FC groups showing a greater increase than the FD group. Additionally, all 3 groups increased their daily flight distances, with the NFD group presenting the largest increase and the FD group presenting the smallest increase. Our findings offer new insights into the relevance of spatiotemporal differences in the management of feeding stations and show its effect on movement during birds’ early life stages, creating 2 main movement patterns: local and regional. Our findings can help decide upon the preferable feeding scheme in a way that will either encourage or reduce the early dispersal distances of fledglings, according to long- and short-term conservation objectives. For example, local movements during the post fledging period to known and stable food resources may reduce the risk of anthropogenic-induced mortality, while it may negatively affect long-term survival by hindering foraging, flight, and exploring skills and affect dispersion to future breeding sites.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2019-06-19 07:07:15.000,2021-09-12 16:46:24.000,470773,"Neophron percnopterus","GPS","RonEfrat (Ron Efrat)"

","rpowell@ncsu.edu","Roger A. Powell","The fisher (Pekania pennanti) population in California is the largest in the Pacific States.  The fisher’s range, however, decreased substantially in the 1900s (Grinnell et al 1937, Zielinski et al. 2005).  Two separate populations currently occur in California, a northwestern population and a southern population. Concern for the status of the fisher in California stimulated a cooperative venture among California Department of Fish & Game, US Fish & Wildlife Service, Sierra Pacific Industries (a private timber company), and North Carolina State University to translocate fishers into the Northern Sierra Nevada. From 2009 to 2011 we released 24 female and 16 males into the Northern Sierra Nevada and Southern Cascade of Northern California. Our goals were to establish a viable a new population of fishers in an area that they had not occupied for greater than 100 years. Additionally, we were committed to the task of understanding why fishers were successful or unsuccessful at establishing themselves through this effort. Thus, we attempted to track each released fisher (and their progeny) using satellite or radio transmitters on a daily basis to understand their movements, habitat preferences, rates of survival and reproduction, and other important factors related to their population dynamics. To date, we have documented establishment of home ranges for nearly all released fishers, high rates of survival, reproduction, and recruitment, and stable or increasing population sizes. Our research continues and regular tracking and locations of animals remains a priority.

Here, we study the interactions between these two types of experience during migration, a critical and challenging period.9,10 We do so by comparing migratory proficiencies between birds with different early-life experiences and explain these differences by testing fine-scale flight mechanisms. We used data collected by GPS transmitters during 127 autumn migrations of 65 individuals to study the flight proficiencies of two groups of Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus), a long-distance, soaring raptor.11,12 The two groups differed greatly in their early-life experience, one group being captive bred and the other wild hatched.13 Both groups improved their migratory performance with acquired experience, exhibiting shorter migration times, longer daily progress, and improved flight skills, specifically more efficient soaring-gliding behavior. The observed improvements were mostly apparent for captive-bred vultures, which were the least efficient during their first migration but were able to catch up in their migratory performance already in the second migration. Thus, we show how the strong negative effects of early-life experience were offset by acquired experience. Our findings uncover how the interaction between early-life and acquired experiences may shape animals’ proficiencies and shed new light on the ontogeny of animal migration, suggesting possible effects of sensitive periods of learning on the acquisition of migratory skills.","research",true,true,false,true,false,"na",2013-09-11 07:00:00.000,2022-10-10 12:47:00.000,4828744,"Neophron percnopterus","GPS,Acceleration","RonEfrat (Ron Efrat)"

Birds showed a small increase in their wingbeat amplitude with increasing turbulence (similar to laboratory studies), but this was accompanied by a reduction in mean wingbeat frequency, such that their flapping wing speed remained the same. Mean kinematic responses to turbulence may therefore enable birds to increase their stability without a reduction in propulsive efficiency. Nonetheless, the most marked response to turbulence was an increase in the variability of wingbeat frequency and amplitude. These stroke-to-stroke changes in kinematics provide instantaneous compensation for turbulence. They will also increase flight costs. Yet pigeons only made small adjustments to their flight altitude, likely resulting in little change in exposure to strong convective turbulence. Responses to turbulence were therefore distinct from responses to wind, with the costs of high turbulence being levied through an increase in the variability of their kinematics and airspeed.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2019-04-03 09:11:32.000,2019-07-18 09:39:12.000,436368,"Columba livia","GPS,Acceleration,Barometer","e.m.lempidakis@gmail.com (Emmanouil Lempidakis)"

Please contact the data owner at wgetz@berkeley.edu for the full dataset. The relationship between resource availability and wildlife movement patterns is pivotal to understanding species behavior and ecology. Movement response to landscape variables occurs at multiple temporal scales, from sub-diurnal to multiannual. Additionally, individuals may respond to both current and past conditions of resource availability. In this paper, we examine the temporal scale and variation of current and past resource variables that affect movement patterns of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) using sub-hourly movement data from GPS-GSM collared elephants in Etosha National Park, Namibia. We created detailed satellite-based spatiotemporal maps of vegetation biomass, as well as distance from surface water, road and fence. We used step selection functions to measure the relative importance of these landscape variables in determining elephants’ local movement patterns. We also examined how elephants respond to information, in locations they have previously visited, on productivity integrated over different temporal scales: from current to historical conditions. Our results demonstrate that elephants choose patches with higher-than average annual productivity and grass biomass, but lower tree biomass. Elephants also prefer to walk close to water, roads, and fences. These preferences vary with time of day and with season, thereby providing insights into diurnal and seasonal behavioral patterns and the ecological importance of the landscape variables examined. We also discovered that elephants respond more strongly to long-term patterns of productivity than to immediate forage conditions, in familiar locations. Our results illustrate how animals with high cognitive capacity and spatial memory integrate long-term information on landscape conditions. We illuminate the importance of long-term high temporal resolution satellite imagery to understanding the relationship between movement patterns and landscape structure.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2008-10-28 00:00:38.000,2014-03-28 12:00:59.000,2930263,"Loxodonta africana","GPS","wgetz (Wayne Getz)"

However, the quantification of spatiotemporal food distribution is rare but crucial to explain variation in foraging behavior among species, populations, or individuals. Clumped but ephemeral food sources enable rapid energy intake but require increased effort to find, can generate variable foraging success, and force animals to forage more efficiently. We quantified seasonal shifts in the availability of such resources to test the proximate effects of food distribution on changes in movement patterns. The neotropical lesser bulldog bat (Noctilio albiventris) forages in a seasonal environment on emerging aquatic insects, whose numbers peak shortly after dusk. We GPS-tracked bats and quantified nocturnal insect distribution in their foraging area using floating camera traps across wet and dry seasons. Surprisingly, insects were 75% less abundant and swarms were 60% shorter lived (more ephemeral) in the wet season. As a result, wet season bats had to fly twice as far (total and maximum distance from roost distances) and 45% longer (duration) per night. Within foraging bouts, wet season bats spent less time in each insect patch and searched longer for subsequent patches, reflecting increased temporal ephemerality and decreased spatial predictability of insects. Our results highlight the tight link between foraging effort and spatiotemporal distribution of food, and the influence of constraints imposed by reproduction on behavioral flexibility and adaptations to the highly dynamic resource landscapes of mobile prey. Examining foraging behavior in light of spatiotemporal dynamics of resources can help predict how animals respond to shifts in food availability caused by escalating environmental changes.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2019-02-11 19:06:51.000,2020-02-14 19:43:50.000,9687,"Noctilio albiventris","GPS","jkohles (Jenna Kohles)"

Argos location errors for blue and fin whale tags were similar and were combined (n = 1,712 locations) for comparison against sperm whale tags (n = 1,206 locations). Location error magnitudes for tags attached to sperm whales were significantly larger than blue/fin whale tags for almost all Argos location classes (LC), ranging from 964 m versus 647 m for LC 3, respectively, to 10,569 m versus 5,589 m for LC B, respectively. However, these differences were not seen while tags floated at the surface after release. Sperm whale tags were significantly colder than ambient temperature when surfacing from a dive, compared to blue/fin whale tags (16.9°C versus 1.3°C, respectively) leading to larger changes in tag temperature during post-dive intervals. The increased rate of tag temperature change while at the surface was correlated to increased error magnitude for sperm whale tags but not blue/fin whale tags. Movement model output was not significantly improved by incorporating species-specific error parameters. Location accuracy estimates for blue/fin whales were within the range estimated for other marine megafauna, but were higher for sperm whales. Thermal inertia from deep, long-duration dives likely caused transmission frequency drift and greater Argos location error in sperm whales, as tags warmed at the surface during post-dive intervals. Thus, tracks of deep-diving species may be less reliable than for other species. However, differences in calculated error magnitude were less than the typical scales of movement and had limited effect on movement model output. Therefore, broad-scale interpretation of Argos tracking data will likely be unaffected, although fine-scale interpretation should be made with more caution for deep-diving species inhabiting warm regions.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2014-08-04 18:55:26.000,2015-08-06 19:04:26.000,4263,"Balaenoptera physalus,Balaenoptera musculus","Argos Doppler Shift","mmiwtg (Barb Lagerquist)"

We assessed the annual cycle of the White-crested Elaenia (Elaenia albiceps chilensis), the longest-distance migrant flycatcher within South America, which breeds in Patagonia and spends the non-breeding season as far north as Amazonia. Using light-level geolocators, we tracked the annual movements of elaenias breeding on southern Patagonia and compared it with movements of elaenias breeding in northern Patagonia (1,365 km north) using Movebank Repository data. We found that elaenias breeding in southern Patagonia successively used two separate non-breeding regions while in their Brazilian non-breeding grounds, as already found for elaenias breeding in the northern Patagonia site. Elaenias breeding in both northern and southern Patagonia also showed high spread in their non-breeding grounds, high non-breeding overlap among individuals from both breeding sites, and similar migration phenology, all of which suggests weak migratory connectivity for this species. Elucidating the annual cycle of this species, with particular emphasis on females and juveniles, still requires further research across a wide expanse of South America.

However, the neural basis of visual landmark-based navigation has been so far investigated mainly in relation to the role of the hippocampal formation. The avian visual Wulst is the telencephalic projection field of the thalamofugal pathway that has been suggested to be involved in processing lateral visual inputs that originate from the far visual field. The Wulst is therefore a good candidate for a neural structure participating in the visual control of familiar visual landmark-based navigation. We repeatedly released and tracked Wulst-lesioned and control homing pigeons from three sites about 10-15 km from the loft. Wulst lesions did not impair the ability of the pigeons to orient homeward during the first release from each of the three sites nor to localise the loft within the home area. In addition, Wulst-lesioned pigeons displayed unimpaired route fidelity acquisition to a repeated homing path compared to the intact birds. However, compared to control birds, Wulst-lesioned pigeons displayed persistent oscillatory flight patterns across releases, diminished attention to linear (leading lines) landscape features, such as roads and wood edges, and less direct flight paths within the home area. Differences and similarities between the effects of Wulst and hippocampal lesions suggest that although the visual Wulst does not seem to play a direct role in the memory representation of a landscape-landmark map, it does seem to participate in influencing the perceptual construction of such a map.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2022-06-13 08:25:03.000,2022-07-22 09:56:07.000,3111842,"Columba livia","GPS","Sara Cioccarelli (Sara Cioccarelli)"

Study Summary	
Project Description 
Lower Skagit Valley in northwest Washington supports one of the largest concentrations of wintering trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator) in the contiguous United States. Like most herbivorous waterfowl, trumpeter swans readily exploit agricultural landscapes for foraging sites. While publicly managed areas of Lower Skagit Valley implement cropland regimens to provide winter forage for a wide array of waterfowl, utility to trumpeter swans is unknown. The goal of this study is to evaluate the utility of managed public lands to trumpeter swans wintering in Lower Skagit Valley by describing proportional use of public to private lands within the framework of a use-availability resource selection design. A collaborative study with CalPoly Humboldt, nineteen (19) trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator) were fitted with Ornitela GPS/GSM collars in either late November, 2023 (1), or late January, 2024 (18). All study subjects were captured and released in the Lower Skagit Valley. The objective of this project is to evaluate the land use patterns and movements of trumpeter swans wintering in Lower Skagit Valley. Data are intended to better inform management priorities of public lands managed by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

The program integrates wildlife health management with conservation efforts to ensure the long-term survival of this endangered species. As tapirs face numerous threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflicts, and disease transmission, the program’s goal is to establish a comprehensive system for assessing the health risks to tapir populations, mitigating those risks, and enhancing coexistence with local communities.

The program operates across various tapir habitats, including biological corridors that connect protected areas. By working in these critical regions, the program focuses on understanding how tapirs move through landscapes, particularly areas where they come into contact with human activities. This overlap between human-dominated landscapes and wildlife habitats increases the likelihood of disease transmission, injury, and conflict, making health surveillance critical for their conservation.

A key aspect of the program is its community-based approach, which involves local stakeholders in data collection and monitoring efforts. The program employs a network of community members, known as “Community Consultants,” who assist in tracking tapir movement, identifying potential health issues, and reporting signs of conflict. This not only increases the program’s reach but also empowers local communities to participate actively in conservation. The team conducts outreach workshops to raise awareness about the role of tapirs in maintaining healthy ecosystems and to encourage sustainable practices that reduce human-tapir conflicts, such as the installation of electric fences around farms.

Health monitoring is conducted through a combination of field techniques, including camera traps, GPS collaring, and direct observation. GPS collars are used to track individual tapirs' movements and assess their use of the landscape. This provides data on their spatial ecology, which is crucial for identifying high-risk areas for disease transmission and conflict. In addition to tracking movement, veterinary teams carry out health assessments on captured tapirs, collecting biological samples (such as blood, feces, and skin) to test for pathogens, parasites, and overall health indicators. The program also monitors tapirs for external injuries or conditions, like infections caused by the screwworm outbreak, which has emerged as a significant threat to wildlife health.

One of the program's primary concerns is disease surveillance, particularly the risk of pathogen spillover from livestock to tapirs, which could have severe consequences for both the species and local ecosystems. The program is designed to identify early warning signs of disease outbreaks and work with veterinary professionals, conservationists, and government agencies to respond swiftly and prevent further spread.

The program is coordinated by a dedicated team of conservationists, veterinarians, and researchers, including the Tapir Specialist Group (TSG) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It benefits from collaboration with rescue centers, such as the Alturas Wildlife Rescue, to treat injured or sick tapirs.

In the long term, the Health Surveillance Program aims to develop a framework for disease management and prevention that can be applied across the tapir’s range. By integrating wildlife health into broader conservation efforts, the program seeks to ensure the resilience of tapir populations, enhance biodiversity, and foster coexistence between tapirs and local communities.","research",true,true,false,false,false,"na",2021-07-15 00:03:06.000,2026-01-08 14:02:36.000,25706,"Tapirella bairdii","GPS","Jorgevet10 (Jorge Rojas )"

In birds, well over half of temperate breeding species migrate to non-breeding locations in the tropics (Rappole 1995) and the degree to which these populations are linked is termed migratory connectivity (Webster et al. 2002, Marra et al. 2006). The linkages between the breeding and non-breeding season can have profound impacts when events from one season “carry-over” and affect events in another season (Marra et al. 1998). For example, dry non-breeding conditions may reduce food availability influencing departure timing, migratory performance and subsequent reproductive effort (Studds & Marra 2011, McKellar et al. 2013, Reudink et al. 2009). As such, characterizing migratory connectivity and seasonal interactions is essential for understanding complex population dynamics and can contribute to the management and conservation of migratory species (Webster & Marra 2005, Marra et al. 2010). Despite the importance of understanding how populations are linked, studying migratory connectivity and finer scale carry-over effects necessitates tracking individuals throughout the annual cycle across large geographic areas.
                  Technology has rapidly advanced our ability to track animals with higher spatial and temporal resolution (Bridge et al. 2011). Within the last five years alone, we have reduced uncertainty about where birds winter from ~150 km (i.e., light-level geolocators; Ryder et al. 2011) to near pin-point 10m accuracy (i.e., GPS geolocators; Hallworth & Marra 2015). This increased resolution allows researchers to track individuals to the non-breeding grounds and study populations that are truly demographically linked to understand how environmental conditions shape migratory timing, speed, arrival, and breeding reproductive performance. Among migratory birds, short-distance migrants that winter within the southern US and Caribbean are a tractable system to jointly study linked population on both ends of the annual cycle because non-breeding sites are more readily accessible. The Gray catbird (Dumatella carolinensis) is a common short-distance migrant breeding in Washington, DC that winters largely in Florida and Cuba (Ryder et al. 2011). Gray catbird abundance, appropriate body size for current tracking technology, and recognizable song make them a good model system for combining science and education about migration biology at the National Zoological Park.
                  Here, we propose a project that quantifies migratory connectivity and seasonal interactions for Gray catbirds using state-of-the-art tracking technology while concurrently educating the public about the grand phenomenon of migration. The projects overarching scientific and educational objectives are: 1) to characterize the migratory connectivity and locate the non-breeding grounds of gray catbirds breeding within the National Zoological park using GPS geolocators, 2) to examine how non-breeding environmental conditions influence reproductive performance in subsequent breeding seasons, 3) to develop informal educational presentations during live animal tagging and formal curriculum to educate the public about migration, and 4) to use the project experience, outreach, and data as a case study for the development and implementation of the tracking station and more broadly the Experience Migration exhibit.","research",false,true,false,false,false,"na",2016-07-01 23:00:06.000,2017-03-27 23:00:10.000,769,"Dumetella carolinensis","GPS","evansbr (Brian Evans)"

Using light-level geolocation, we obtained three full annual tracks and one autumn migration track of male red-necked phalaropes caught during breeding in Scandinavia. These tracks confirmed expectations that individuals from the Scandinavian population winter in the Arabian Sea. Migration was accomplished in two to four migration leaps, staging for a few days in the Gulf of Finland (autumn) or the southern Baltic Sea (spring) and for up to a month in or near the Black and Caspian Sea (autumn and spring). In addition, travel speeds suggested that only the flights between the Baltic and Black/Caspian Sea are non-stop, and thus the birds seem to make additional short stops during the other flights. Stopover time in the Black/Caspian Sea is only 8-10 days in spring but up to 36 days in autumn, which is longer than expected if only used for pre-migratory fattening to cover the ca. 2000 km to the Gulf of Oman. After entering the Arabian Sea via the Gulf of Oman, birds dispersed over the entire presumed winter range. Winter movements appear to correspond to the spatio-temporal patterns in primary production linked to seasonally changing monsoon winds. These are not only the first tracks of Scandinavian red-necked phalaropes, but also the first seabird tracks in the Arabian Sea, one of the most productive and dynamic marine areas on the planet.

We found that wingbeat frequency has the strongest positive relationship with ODBA.

Bats flew at ground speeds of 9.6 ± 2.4 ms-1 (mean ± sd, range: 4.3 to 23.9 ms-1) and airspeeds of 10.2 ± 2.5 ms-1, and did not modify their wingbeat frequency with speed. Free-ranging straw-colored fruit bats therefore exerted more total ODBA in headwinds but not when they changed their airspeed.

All capture and handling protocols are approved by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation permit LCPSCI#2645. Fishers were captured using Tomahawk Model 108s live-traps covered in custom wooden shelters and baited with meat and lure between December and mid-March. Fishers are maneuvered into a custom handling cone and physically restrained to administer an intra-muscular injection of Ketamine HCL (200 mg/mL concentration, 0.1 mL/kg dosage) and Xylazine HCL (300 mg/mL concentration, 0.01 mL/kg dosage) to the rump. Bobcats were captured with Camtrip cages covered in debris and landscape cloth, baited with visual attractants and lures. Bobcats were sedated while in the cage trap via a 3cc syringe pole with and intramuscular injection of Ketamine HCL at 0.05 mL/kg and Xylazine HCL at 0.005 mL/kg. Both species were covered and undisturbed while the sedatives take effect and Yohimbine HCL is available if a Ketamine reversal is needed. Once sedated, all animals are monitored for breathing and heart rates and body temperature during handling, and an eye ointment was applied to prevent dryness and debris from entering the eye.

GPS collars were affixed to suitable animals: e-obs GmbH, weighing 69 g for female fishers (3% of mean body mass), 20 g for male fishers and female bobcats (2.7% of male fishers, 1.3% female bobcats), and 170 g for male bobcats (<1% male bobcats).","research",true,true,false,true,false,"na",2020-02-12 16:02:53.000,2023-07-28 23:58:13.000,122969,"Lynx rufus,Pekania pennanti","GPS,Acceleration","sdlapoint (Scott LaPoint)"

Argos location errors for blue and fin whale tags were similar and were combined (n = 1,712 locations) for comparison against sperm whale tags (n = 1,206 locations). Location error magnitudes for tags attached to sperm whales were significantly larger than blue/fin whale tags for almost all Argos location classes (LC), ranging from 964 m versus 647 m for LC 3, respectively, to 10,569 m versus 5,589 m for LC B, respectively. However, these differences were not seen while tags floated at the surface after release. Sperm whale tags were significantly colder than ambient temperature when surfacing from a dive, compared to blue/fin whale tags (16.9°C versus 1.3°C, respectively) leading to larger changes in tag temperature during post-dive intervals. The increased rate of tag temperature change while at the surface was correlated to increased error magnitude for sperm whale tags but not blue/fin whale tags. Movement model output was not significantly improved by incorporating species-specific error parameters. Location accuracy estimates for blue/fin whales were within the range estimated for other marine megafauna, but were higher for sperm whales. Thermal inertia from deep, long-duration dives likely caused transmission frequency drift and greater Argos location error in sperm whales, as tags warmed at the surface during post-dive intervals. Thus, tracks of deep-diving species may be less reliable than for other species. However, differences in calculated error magnitude were less than the typical scales of movement and had limited effect on movement model output. Therefore, broad-scale interpretation of Argos tracking data will likely be unaffected, although fine-scale interpretation should be made with more caution for deep-diving species inhabiting warm regions.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2011-07-10 23:16:00.000,2013-09-18 17:37:19.000,7759,"Physeter macrocephalus","GPS","mmiwtg (Barb Lagerquist)"

Given the migratory tendencies of this species, it is plausible that blue-winged teal may disperse avian pathogens between spatially distant areas. To better understand the potential role of blue-winged teal in the exchange of avian pathogens between North America and areas further south, we collected information on migratory tendencies of this species and sampled birds at spatially distant areas during breeding and non-breeding periods. Forty-two adult, male blue-winged teal were captured and marked. Twelve birds were captured on their summer range in the Saskatchewan and Alberta Canadian Provinces during August 11-15, 2013, with the remaining thirty birds captured at wintering areas along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast in the United States during March 17-22, 2015.

The consequences of human-mediated disturbance in natural areas are documented for avian and mammalian species. Less is known about the consequences of human disturbance on reptile species, specifically snakes, residing in natural refuges within the urban matrix. Thus we examined the spatial activity of copperheads (Agkistrodon contortrix) in regard to pedestrian trails within an urban forest. We used radio telemetry to track snakes during the active season, and estimated distances moved in between relocations, distances to the nearest trail, and home range size for individuals. We found sex and season, but not distance to the nearest trail, affected the distance snakes moved. In addition, we observed a weak, positive relationship between home range size and average distance to the trail. Sex, season, and body condition did not explain snake distance to the trail, but individual patterns were variable for snakes compared to random locations generated from snake relocations. Our study indicates copperheads may be tolerant of low-level human disturbances found in an urban forest. Further work should be done to quantify levels of disturbance, such as trail use, and compare the behavior of reptiles across urban park types and locations.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2015-06-11 16:36:00.000,2018-06-29 15:22:00.000,1630,"Agkistrodon contortrix","Radio Transmitter","mfcarrasco (Malle Carrasco-Harris)"

However, their distribution and movements are poorly known. The goal of this study was to describe fin whale movements for the first time from 11 Argos satellite tags deployed in the southwest GoC in March 2001. A Bayesian Switching State-Space Model was applied to obtain improved locations and to characterize movement behavior as either “area-restricted searching” (indicative of patch residence, ARS) or “transiting” (indicative of moving between patches). Model performance was assessed with convergence diagnostics and by examining the distribution of the deviance and the behavioral parameters from Markov Chain Monte Carlo models. ARS was the predominant mode behavior 83% of the time during both the cool (December-May) and warm seasons (June-November), with slower travel speeds (mean= 0.84 km/h) than during transiting mode (mean= 3.38 km/h). We suggest ARS mode indicates either foraging activities (year around) or reproductive activities during the winter (cool season). We tagged during the cool season, when the whales were located in the Loreto-La Paz Corridor in the southwestern GoC, close to the shoreline. As the season progressed, individuals moved northward to the Midriff Islands and the upper gulf for the warm season, much farther from shore. One tag lasted long enough to document a whale’s return to Loreto the following cool season. One whale that was originally of undetermined sex, was tagged in the Bay of La Paz and was photographed 10 years later with a calf in the nearby San Jose Channel, suggesting seasonal site fidelity. The tagged whales moved along the western GoC to the upper gulf seasonally and did not transit to the eastern GoC south of the Midriff Islands. No tagged whales left the GoC, providing supporting evidence that these fin whales are a resident population.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2001-03-22 23:48:24.000,2001-09-05 02:55:33.000,513,"Balaenoptera physalus","Argos Doppler Shift","mmiwtg (Barb Lagerquist)"

Argos location errors for blue and fin whale tags were similar and were combined (n = 1,712 locations) for comparison against sperm whale tags (n = 1,206 locations). Location error magnitudes for tags attached to sperm whales were significantly larger than blue/fin whale tags for almost all Argos location classes (LC), ranging from 964 m versus 647 m for LC 3, respectively, to 10,569 m versus 5,589 m for LC B, respectively. However, these differences were not seen while tags floated at the surface after release. Sperm whale tags were significantly colder than ambient temperature when surfacing from a dive, compared to blue/fin whale tags (16.9°C versus 1.3°C, respectively) leading to larger changes in tag temperature during post-dive intervals. The increased rate of tag temperature change while at the surface was correlated to increased error magnitude for sperm whale tags but not blue/fin whale tags. Movement model output was not significantly improved by incorporating species-specific error parameters. Location accuracy estimates for blue/fin whales were within the range estimated for other marine megafauna, but were higher for sperm whales. Thermal inertia from deep, long-duration dives likely caused transmission frequency drift and greater Argos location error in sperm whales, as tags warmed at the surface during post-dive intervals. Thus, tracks of deep-diving species may be less reliable than for other species. However, differences in calculated error magnitude were less than the typical scales of movement and had limited effect on movement model output. Therefore, broad-scale interpretation of Argos tracking data will likely be unaffected, although fine-scale interpretation should be made with more caution for deep-diving species inhabiting warm regions.","research",false,true,false,true,false,"na",2011-07-11 01:36:44.000,2013-09-19 03:09:46.000,5630,"Physeter macrocephalus","Argos Doppler Shift","mmiwtg (Barb Lagerquist)"
